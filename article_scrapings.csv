Transmission patterns of HIV-1 non-R5 strains in Poland,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41407-7,Research,21 March 2019,yes,"hiv-1 env sequencing enables predictions of viral coreceptor tropism and phylogenetic investigations of transmission events. the aim of the study was to estimate the contribution of non-r5 strains to the viral spread in poland. partial proviral env sequences were retrieved from baseline blood samples of patients with newly diagnosed hiv-1 infection between 2008–2014, including 46 patients with recent hiv-1 infection (rhi), and 246 individuals with long-term infection (lthi). these sequences were subjected to the genotypic coreceptor tropism predictions and phylogenetic analyses to identify transmission clusters. overall, 27 clusters with 57 sequences (19.5%) were detected, including 15 sequences (26.3%) from patients with rhi. the proportion of non-r5 strains among all study participants was 23.3% (68/292), and was comparable between patients with rhi and lthi (11/46, 23.9% vs 57/246, 23.2%; p = 1.000). all 11 patients with non-r5 strains and rhi were men having sex with men (msm). among these patients, 4 had viral sequences grouped within phylogenetic cluster with another sequence of non-r5 strain obtained from patient with lthi, indicating potential acquisition of non-r5 hiv-1 for at least 4/46 (8.7%) patients with rhi. we were unable to confirm the contribution of patients with rhi to the forward transmission of non-r5 strains, but a relatively high proportion of non-r5 strains among them deserves attention due to the limited susceptibility to ccr5 antagonists.
introduction human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) surface glycoprotein (gp120), a product of viral env gene, plays a key role in cell entry, viral tropism, pathogenesis, vulnerability to the host immune response and susceptibility to the entry inhibitors such as maraviroc1,2,3. the third variable loop (v3) of the gp120 contributes to the hiv-1 entrance into target cells by binding to the cell cd4 receptor followed by attachment to either the ccr5 or cxcr4 coreceptor molecules1,4. viruses that during cell entry exclusively use the ccr5 or cxcr4 coreceptor are termed r5 or x4, respectively, whereas those that can use both coreceptors are described as r5x4 viruses. usually, r5 viruses are associated with hiv-1 transmission and predominate at early phases of infection, while x4 or r5x4 (non-r5) viruses emerge as infection develops1, and are linked to accelerated disease progression and decline of cd4+ t-cell counts5,6,7. although several mechanisms of selection against transmission of x4 viruses were proposed8,9, it has been reported that also cxcr4-using hiv-1 variants can be transmitted to a new host, e.g. to individuals lacking functional ccr5 receptor10. the proportion of infections with cxcr4-using strains investigated among patients with early infection stages, suggesting transmission of x4 variants, ranged from 3% to 26% depending on the population examined and method used to assess viral coreceptor tropism5,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.to date, studies on hiv-1 coreceptor tropism in poland were restricted to the northern geographic region and were performed among patients with long-term hiv-1 infection and experience of antiretroviral therapy21, and among treatment-naïve persons with a new hiv-1 diagnosis22. in the second group the overall prevalence of non-r5 strains was 15.5% or 27.8% depending on the interpretation criteria used in genotypic tropism test, and an increase in the frequency of non-r5 strains during the study period was observed, suggesting either increase of late hiv-1 diagnoses or putative transmission of cxcr4-using viruses in the local population22. nevertheless, these studies did not allow to evaluate the rate of transmission of non-r5 strains, while this information would be useful for reasonable planning of treatment programs, especially in the context of the strong push to identify early hiv-1 infections, and the potential role of ccr5 antagonists in pre-exposure prophylaxis23.the analysis of hiv-1 env gene sequences enables not only genotypic predictions of viral coreceptor tropism, but also allows for phylogenetic investigations aimed at detection of transmission clusters, which can facilitate the understanding of the epidemiological links. thus, it is possible to study the contribution of patients with specified characteristics to hiv-1 transmission, and e.g. confirm the forward transmission of non-r5 strains or viral spread from patients at different infection stages24,25,26.to obtain a more complete picture of the hiv-1 epidemics in poland, analyses of env gene viral sequences from patients with new hiv-1 diagnosis established in the years 2008–2014 and known proportion of recent hiv-1 infections, were performed. investigations included viral and host characteristics associated with coreceptor tropism and identified transmission clusters, in order to trace the spread of non-r5 hiv-1 strains and assess the contribution of recent infections to the polish hiv-1 epidemic.resultspatients and virus characteristicsthe characteristics of the 292 patients included in the analysis are presented in table 1. all study participants were of polish origin and were naïve for antiretroviral therapy. among them there were 46 (15.8%) patients with recent hiv-1 infection (rhi), and 246 (84.2%) individuals with long-term hiv-1 infection (lthi). sexual contacts between men were the most frequently reported transmission route (199/292; 68.2%), with the proportion not significantly different in groups with dissimilar duration of infection (rhi: 35/46, 76.1% vs lthi: 164/246, 66.7%; p = 0.232). similarly, there were no statistical differences between patients with rhi and lthi with respect to other transmission routes, sex, age, and ccr5 δ32 genotype status. although patients recruited in chorzów predominated in the study (130/292; 44.5%), patients recruited in wrocław constituted the most numerous group among the individuals with rhi (21/46; 45.7%; p = 0.007). a statistically significant difference between individuals with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection was observed for median baseline cd4+ t-lymphocyte count (rhi: 564 vs lthi: 396 cells/µl; p = 0.002), and proportion of patients with higher cd4+ t-lymphocyte count at diagnosis (>500 cells/μl – rhi: 26/43, 60.5% vs lthi: 79/229, 34.5%; p = 0.002). a baseline hiv-1 viral load, usually high at early infection stages, unexpectedly was significantly higher among patients with lthi (rhi: 4.19 vs lthi: 4.51 log copies/ml; p = 0.045) (table 1). we note however, that the average delay between the diagnosis and the sample collection in our study was 32 days, which means that in many cases of recent infection we may have captured an already stabilised viral load, rather than the initial peak.table 1 characteristics of the study participants diagnosed in the years 2008–2014 with hiv-1 env sequences available.full size tableaccording to the subtype analysis of 292 hiv-1 env sequences, the majority of patients were infected with subtype b (279; 95.6%) (table 2). among 13 patients with non-b subtype infection, there were 8 individuals harbouring sub-subtype a6 (2.7%), 3 persons with crf50_a1d infection, and remaining 2 persons were infected with crf02_ag and sub-subtype f1, respectively. strains of sub-subtype a6 were detected in all four diagnostic centres, and among patients who acquired hiv-1 infection either through same sex contact between men (n = 5) or heterosexual contact (n = 1) or via drug injections (n = 2), while crf50_a1d strains were found exclusively in kraków, among patients with homosexual (n = 2) or heterosexual (n = 1) route of transmission. crf02_ag and f1 were identified in men who have sex with men (msm) recruited in kraków and wrocław, respectively. there were no statistically significant differences regarding subtype frequency between patients with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection (p = 0.176). however, non-b subtypes were significantly less frequent among patients diagnosed in chorzów than in other cities (chorzów: 2/130, 1.5% vs other diagnostics centres: 11/162, 6.8% p = 0.043), and more frequent among patients diagnosed in kraków (kraków: 5/41, 12.2% vs other diagnostics centres: 8/251, 3.2% p = 0.023).table 2 virus characteristics based on gp120 sequences obtained from the study participants in the years 2008–2014.full size tablethe median frequency of ambiguous nucleotides in the analysed env sequences was significantly lower among patients with rhi than those with lthi (rhi: 0% (0–0) vs lthi: 0.14% (0–0.41); p < 0.001) (table 2).coreceptor usagethe frequency of non-r5 strains among all patients included in the study was 23.3% (68/292) when the geno2pheno 10% fpr cut-off was applied for the subtype b sequences and phenoseq results were used for non-b subtypes (table 2). the same frequency of non-r5 variants was observed for all sequences analysed with geno2pheno 10% fpr only. applying geno2pheno fpr cut-off values of 15% and 20% resulted in the frequency of non-r5 strains as high as 34.9% (102/292) and 45.5% (133/292), respectively. with the more restrictive 5.75% fpr cut-off the frequency of non-r5 strains was decreased to 9.6% (28/292). there were no significant differences between persons with rhi and lthi regarding the frequency of the non-r5 strains, and values of geno2pheno fprs were comparable between patients with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection (p = 0.578) (table 2).comparison of all patients harbouring non-r5 and r5 strains predicted by geno2pheno 10% fpr for the subtype b sequences and phenoseq for non-b subtypes revealed no significant differences with regard to sex, age, city of diagnosis, ccr5 δ32 genotype, median viral load, and hiv-1 subtype (table 3). similarly, no significant differences were seen between non-r5 and r5 strains with respect to the number of ambiguous nucleotides and deduced ambiguous amino acids in v3 coding region. when the same comparisons were performed exclusively among persons with rhi, again the lack of significant differences between non-r5 and r5 strains was observed. a trend toward a higher proportion of msm among patients with non-r5 strains in comparison with those harbouring r5 strains, was observed when all samples were tested (p = 0.054). this trend reached the level of statistical significance when analysis was restricted to the samples obtained from patients with recent hiv-1 infection only (p = 0.044) (table 3).table 3 comparison of patients harbouring non-r5 and r5 strains predicted by v3 analysis with geno2pheno 10% fpr (for subtype b) and phenoseq (for non-b subtypes) algorithms.full size tabletransmission clustersamong 292 hiv-1 sequences there were 27 transmission clusters containing 57 sequences (19.5%) identified (table 4, fig. 1). these clusters included from 2 to 3 sequences, with the majority of clusters containing only 2 sequences (24/27, 88.9%). the differences between patients with clustered and non-clustered hiv-1 sequences regarding the proportion of individuals of different sex, age, city of hiv-1 diagnosis, ccr5 δ32 genotype, or infected with different hiv-1 subtypes or strains of different tropism were not significant, although a trend toward a higher prevalence of men within the group of patients with clustered sequences was noticed (p = 0.058) (table 4). patients with heterosexual transmission route were exclusively infected with viruses of non-clustered env sequences (p < 0.001), while patients for whom the route of transmission was unknown were more frequently represented among individuals with clustered hiv-1 sequences than among those with non-clustered sequences (p = 0.015). similarly, higher proportion of msm was observed within the group of clustered hiv-1 sequences, but the difference was not statistically significant (clustered: 44/57, 77.2% vs non-clustered: 155/235, 66.0%; p = 0.115). while the majority of clustered hiv-1 sequences were obtained from patients with lthi (42/57, 73.7%), the proportion of sequences from persons with rhi was higher among clustered sequences than among non-clustered sequences (clustered: 15/57, 26.3% vs non-clustered: 31/235, 13.2%; p = 0.024).table 4 comparison of patients with clustered and non-clustered hiv-1 env sequences and characteristics of clusters identified among 292 hiv-1 sequences.full size tablefigure 1mcmc phylogenetic tree of env sequences obtained from 292 patients diagnosed in poland in the years 2008–2014. transmission clusters identified with the maximum likelihood alrt value of >90%, maximum intracluster pairwise genetic distance <3%, and posterior probability of 1 in bayesian inference are highlighted. clusters highlighted in green contain sequences obtained from patients with long-term and recent hiv-1 infection. clusters highlighted in grey and light blue contain sequences obtained from patients with long-term hiv-1 infection only and recent hiv-1 infection only, respectively. squares indicate the presence of non-r5 strains. self-reported transmission routes for patients with clustered hiv-1 sequences are specified with msm (for sex between men), msm/het (for sex between men or women and men), idu (for injecting drug use), o/unk (for other/unknown). majority of sequences represented subtype b, thus only non-b subtypes are indicated.full size imagethe levels of baseline median viral load were comparable between patients infected with hiv-1 strains of clustered and non-clustered sequences. the median cd4+ t-cell count at diagnosis was significantly higher among patients from whom clustered hiv-1 sequences were obtained than among persons with non-clustered viral sequences (clustered: 502 vs non-clustered: 399; p = 0.041), and accordingly, the proportion of patients with cd4+ t-cell counts of <200/µl was significantly lower among those harbouring hiv-1 with clustered sequences, while the proportion of patients with >500 cd4+ t-cell counts among them was significantly higher (table 4).to give a more detailed description of the 57 patients harbouring hiv-1 with clustered sequences and putatively engaged in transmission events, the numbers of clusters gathering hiv-1 sequences from patients of the same characteristics (sex, age group, city of diagnosis, transmission route, non-r5 strain infection, hiv-1 infection status), as well as the numbers of sequences in such clusters, were calculated (table 4). since the majority of clustered hiv-1 sequences were obtained from men, also the majority of clusters contained exclusively sequences obtained from men (25 clusters with 53 sequences), and only a single cluster contained one sequence from a woman and another from a man. nine clusters included 18 hiv-1 sequences from persons under 30 years old only, 6 clusters contained 13 hiv-1 sequences from persons ≥30 years old only, and 11 clusters gathered 24 sequences from patients of <30 and ≥30 together. one cluster contained 2 sequences from persons for whom the information on sex and age was unavailable. the majority of clusters included sequences obtained from patients diagnosed with hiv-1 in the same location (23 clusters with 49 sequences). in the 4 remaining clusters, sequences obtained from patients recruited in different centres were grouped; within each of these 4 clusters there was 1 sequences from patient diagnosed in chorzów combined either with sequence from patient diagnosed in wrocław (3 clusters) or in kraków (1 cluster) (table 4, fig. 2a).figure 2hiv-1 transmission clusters inferred from the analysis of env sequences obtained from 292 study participants diagnosed in the years 2008–2014. clusters were identified with the maximum likelihood alrt value of >90%, maximum intracluster pairwise genetic distance <3%, and posterior probability of 1 in bayesian inference. viral tropism is indicated with shapes: squares and circles represent sequences of non-r5 and r5 strains, respectively. for all patients with clustering viral sequences shapes are colored according to: city of hiv-1 diagnosis (a), self-reported transmission route (msm - sex between men, msm/het - sex between men or women and men, idu - injecting drug use, o/unk - other/unknown) (b), and duration of hiv-1 infection (c).full size imagethe majority of clusters included sequences from persons who declared the same route of hiv-1 transmission, namely 17 clusters contained 36 sequences obtained exclusively from msm, and 1 cluster gathered 2 sequences from persons with unknown transmission route (table 4, figs 1 and 2b). among the remaining 9 mixed clusters, all but one contained at least one sequence from an msm or msm who also reported sex with women. three mixed clusters included sequences from injecting drug users (idus), but none of these 3 sequences came from a person with rhi.most of clustered hiv-1 sequences obtained from patients with lthi (27/42) were grouped within 13 clusters gathering only the sequences from patients with lthi (table 4, figs 1 and 2c). the next 13 clusters contained sequences from both, persons with lthi (15 sequences) and patients with rhi (13 sequences). there was only one cluster with 2 sequences from patients with rhi only.to infer about possible transmission events from patients with recent hiv-1 infection we examined the sample collection dates for persons with viral sequences gathered in a single transmission cluster. these dates were checked for all 14 clusters containing 15 sequences obtained from patients with rhi. onward transmission during the recency period could not be the case for any of the 2 patients with rhi, whose viral sequences were grouped in a single cluster, since one patient was recruited to the study over 4 years earlier than the second one, and therefore could be engaged in transmission only during long-standing hiv-1 infection. for 10 out of 13 mixed clusters, i.e. containing sequences from persons with rhi and lthi, the date of sample collection for a patient with rhi was less than 6 months earlier than the sampling date for any patient with lthi involved in the same cluster, thus we were not able to unambiguously demonstrate that these patients with recent hiv-1 infection were engaged in forward transmission.as many as 23 clusters contained sequences of hiv-1 strains of the same tropism, among them there were 17 clusters with 36 sequences of r5 strains, and 6 clusters with 12 sequences of non-r5 variants. the remaining 9 clustered sequences were included within 4 mixed clusters, with sequences of r5 and non-r5 strains gathered simultaneously in each cluster (table 4, figs 1 and 2). non-r5 strains were identified among 11 out of 46 patients with rhi, which may suggest acquisition of non-r5 variants for these patients. among these 11 patients there were 5 with viral sequences grouped within 5 separate transmission clusters, and 6 with non-clustered sequences. more detailed characteristic of all patients with putative acquired non-r5 strains infection is presented in table 5. briefly, patients with possible acquired non-r5 infection were msm with hiv-1 subtype b, most of them (7/11) were diagnosed in chorzów. ccr5 genotypes wt/δ32 and δ32/δ32 were identified in 3 of 11 patients (27.3%) with putative acquired non-r5 strains infection, and were not significantly more frequent than among patients with rhi harbouring r5 strains (5/35, 14.3%; p = 0.374). among 5 clustered sequences obtained from patients with recent hiv-1 infection and non-r5 strains, there were 4 that grouped with non-r5 strains, further supporting potential acquisition of non-r5 strains for 4 out of 46 patients with rhi (8.7%) (table 5).table 5 possible acquired non-r5 strains infections among patients with clustered and non-clustered hiv-1 sequences.full size tabletime trendsthe proportion of patients diagnosed during recent hiv-1 infection has increased significantly from 9.9% (7/71) in 2008 to 23.6% (13/55) in 2013 and 25% (1/4) in 2014 with an average annual difference of +3.15% per year (or: 1.26, 95% ci: 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005) (table 6). consistently, there were significantly increasing mean cd4+ t-cell counts from 460 ± 249 in 2008 to 550 ± 354 in 2013 (slope =+22.1/year, p = 0.008). significantly increasing trend in the cd4+ t-cell counts was not visible, when the analysis was restricted to patients with rhi (p = 0.286), but was true for the group of patients with lthi (slope =+18.0/year, p = 0.047). analysis of the viral load revealed no significant time trends, neither for all patients nor for patients with rhi or lthi, separately.table 6 the logistic and linear regression analyses of time trends in selected parameters for patients with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection – years 2008–2014.full size tablein line with the decreasing proportion of women among hiv-1 infections (from 11.3%, 8/71 in 2008 to 0% in 2013 and 2014; average annual difference = −2.38%/year, or: 0.68, 95% ci: 0.52–0.91, p = 0.003), the proportion of msm has increased significantly from 53.5% (38/71) in 2008 to 85.5% (47/55) in 2013 and 75% (3/4) in 2014 (average annual difference =  + 6.80%/year, or: 1.43, 95% ci: 1.23–1.66, p < 0.001), and the percent of patients who reported heterosexual intercourses as a transmission route significantly decreased in this time period from 22.5% (16/71) to 3.6% (2/55) and 0% in 2014 (average annual difference = −5.10%/year, or: 0.61, 95% ci: 0.49–0.77, p < 0.001), while the proportion of idus was stable (p = 0.340). similar temporal trends for the mode of hiv-1 transmission were visible within the group of patients with lthi, while the proportions of persons with the three transmission routes did not change significantly among patients with rhi (table 6).the proportion of non-r5 strains was stable over time with a slight decrease over the studied period (average annual difference = −1.52%/year, p = 0.234), and geno2pheno fpr values were also stable over time (p = 0.404). similarly, there was a stable proportion of clustered hiv-1 sequences (p = 0.634), and the percent of infections with non-b subtypes over time (p = 0.445). the age at diagnosis was also stable throughout the examined time range (p = 0.108). the same stable trends were observed in the separate analyses restricted to the patients with rhi and lthi, with the exception of a tendency to the less frequent clustered transmission through years among patients with rhi (p = 0.074) (table 6).discussion in the studied group of 292 patients with hiv-1 infection diagnosed in the years 2008–2014 in four centers for hiv diagnostics and therapy for aids located in southern and central poland (chorzów, kraków, łódź, and wrocław) recent hiv-1 infections accounted for 15.8% of all newly diagnosed infections. this is a much smaller proportion of recent infections than observed in poland in 2006 with the bed assay (44%)27. although the latter may have been overestimated due to the substantial false recent rate of the bed test, it also coincides with significant upsurge of infections among msm, which occurred in the mid-200028. thus, the smaller, but gradually increasing, percent of recent infections observed in the current study likely represents a real feature of the epidemic. in the current study recent hiv-1 infection status was detected with quantitative limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (lag-avidity eia), which provides the false recent rate as low as 1.3% (0.3–3.2)29. the accuracy of rhi assessment by the lag-avidity eia seems to be supported by the significantly lower frequency of ambiguous nucleotides in env sequences obtained from individuals with rhi than in sequences from patients with lthi, as the proportion of ambiguous nucleotides is known to increase with the stage of infection30.the overall frequency of non-b subtypes in the examined group was 4.5% (13/292), and was comparable for patients with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection. nevertheless, this value was considerably lower than the frequency of non-b clades determined in other polish study covering similar time period (112/946; 11.8%; p < 0.001)31. the generally low frequency of non-b hiv-1 variants observed in our study may be explained by low frequency of non-b subtypes among samples obtained from patients diagnosed in upper silesia region (chorzów, 2/130; 1.5%), which constituted the most prevalent group in our research, and were not included in the previous study. this finding supports the notion that the prevalence of non-b hiv-1 subtypes may differ by geographic region. additionally, hiv-1 infections with sub-subtype a6 and crf50_a1d which were previously reported to spread in former soviet union area and western european countries, respectively32,33, were detected in poland for the first time. similarly to the previous study31, the proportion of non-b variants in our study was stable throughout the study period.admittedly, patients with hiv-1 diagnosis during long-term infection predominated in our study. however, we found both, a significant increase of the proportion of recent infections and an increase in cd4+ t-cell count among the new hiv diagnoses over the study period, from 2008 to 2014. these data suggest that during the study period the average time from infection to hiv diagnosis decreased, although this decrease was not spectacular and should be presumably measured in weeks or months rather than in years. indeed, such a decline in the estimated mean interval of time-to-hiv-diagnosis from 4.0 in 2001 to 3.2 years in 2010 was previously reported for msm in united kingdom34, and a gradual decrease of time from infection to diagnosis was observed between 2012 and 2016 across the european union35. it is also in line with the previously described increasing testing rates36, and higher rates of hiv-1 testing associated with the same-sex sexual exposure37.the overall distribution of the transmission routes reported by patients with rhi and lthi was comparable. however, there was a significant annual decrease in the proportion of women and individuals infected through heterosexual contact, coupled with an increase in proportion of msm. these temporal trends for the hiv-1 transmission route were observed within the whole studied group and among patients with lthi and rhi separately, only in the latter group not reaching the level of significance. hence, these data may confirm increase in the frequency of msm testing for hiv-1 infection, and indicate that the epidemic among msm in poland was on the rise, while the increasing testing rates were still not sufficient to achieve an hiv diagnosis within the first 6 months after infection in the majority of cases.in the analysis of phylogenetic clusters, sequences from 15 (32.6%) out of 46 patients with rhi were included in 14 clusters. similarly to other reports38,39, sequences from individuals with rhi were notably more frequent within the clusters than outside the clusters (26.3% vs 13.2%). this higher frequency may be explained by the fact that the samples obtained in early infection experience minimal genetic divergence and are more likely to cluster with the putative donor sequence24. besides, the majority of clustering sequences obtained from patients with rhi (13/15) were grouped with the sequences derived from patients with lthi. considering that in most of these mixed clusters the date of sample collection for a patient with rhi was less than 6 months earlier than the sampling date for a patient with lthi or the sample collection dates were the same for both patients, it may suggest that the patients with long-standing infection were presumably responsible for the virus propagation, with most of them likely transmitting the virus before being hiv-1-diagnosed, and thus being not aware of their hiv-1 status. although such an assumption could be confirmed by the medical interview data only in the case of one pair of patients with rhi and lthi, it is in line with the results of the country-wide survey performed among msm in the netherlands revealing that over 70% of transmission events in the years 1996–2010 originated from undiagnosed individuals40. on the other hand, the lack of clustering for 67.4% (31/46) of sequences from patients with rhi may indicate that a considerable proportion of hiv-1 infections could be transmitted by undiagnosed (or not linked to care) individuals. however, due to the relatively low sample size in our study, also individuals that were not sampled should be considered as a potential source of hiv-1 infection for patients with rhi.the frequency of clustered hiv-1 sequences identified in our study (57/292, 19.5%) was within the range of the frequencies observed in other european and north american hiv-1-positive groups38,41,42,43,44,45. similarly to other european and north american cohorts38,41,42,43,44,45,46 the proportion of msm (together with men who reported sex with either men or women as a transmission route) was significantly higher among patients with clustered sequences compared to non-clustered (clustered: 48/57, 84.2% vs non-clustered: 164/235, 69.8%; p = 0.031), showing that, like in other regions, the epidemic in southern and central poland has been driven mainly by msm. however, according to our data, unlike in most other studies38,41,43,44,45,46, patients with clustered hiv sequences were not significantly younger than patients with viral sequences located outside the clusters.according to our data, the proportion of all sequences clustering with other sequences was stable over time or tended to decrease during the study period among samples obtained from patients with rhi. this is opposite to what was observed in a prior study in poland, where significantly increasing trends for clustered transmissions were reported46. however, we only collected samples from four of 16 regions in poland. in our sample 4/27 clusters (14.8%) contained sequences from different regions. such interregional clusters with highly related sequences coming from different regions were also found by other researchers in poland46 and germany44, and in comparison to our results the proportion of these clusters was shown to be higher (31/109, 28.4% and 32/184, 17.4%, respectively). it is possible that due to increasing mixing, other patients with clustering sequences were diagnosed in other regions of poland, and therefore were not captured, explaining the lower than expected level of interregional clusters in our study. in line with other studies44,46, sequences from msm were the most common in the interregional clusters (7/8, 87.5%), confirming the role of msm in bridging regional hiv epidemics.the overall prevalence of non-r5 strains in our study was 23% as detected with geno2pheno 10% fpr for subtype b samples and phenoseq for non-b subtypes or geno2pheno 10% fpr for all samples, and was slightly lower than non-r5 prevalence determined in the former study (28%) with the geno2pheno 10% fpr, among newly diagnosed patients from northern poland22. this small discrepancy could have resulted from the diverse approach to tropism prediction in both studies, namely single vs triplicate sequencing of v3 coding region in the current and the previous study, respectively. triplicate genotypic v3 testing is able detect more non-r5 variant in comparison with analysis of single sequences. however, tropism predictions using v3 genotyping based on single or triplicate testing using geno2pheno with a fpr of 10% were shown to be comparable, and the high concordance of tropism prediction among samples with single and triplicate amplification stands behind the use of single amplification in diagnostic practice47,48,49,50,51. alternatively, the lower frequency of non-r5 viruses in our study may be explained by the local, within-country differences in the occurrence of cxcr4-using strains. this may be supported by the observed stable prevalence of non-r5 strains during the study period among all patients with new hiv-1 diagnoses and among patients with recent and long-term hiv-1 infection separately, whereas in previous study performed in northern poland an increasing trend for the frequency of the non-r5 strains was reported among patients with new diagnoses22. it is also noteworthy that the median value of geno2pheno fpr in our study was relatively low (23.5%; (10.5–49.8%)), since it was demonstrated that low baseline fpr determined by the geno2pheno tool can predict tropism switch from ccr5 to cxcr4, and patients with r5 viruses predicted at diagnosis with a geno2pheno fpr of less than 50% (or <40.6%) were more prone to switch coreceptor over time than patients with fpr values of >50% (or >40.6)17,52.the presence of non-r5 strains among persons with rhi may suggest possible transmission of non-r5 strains. in the current study, the frequency of non-r5 strains was comparable between groups of patients with rhi (24%) and lthi (23%). such a relatively high frequency of cxcr4-using strains among patients with rhi was not commonly observed in other groups of patients with similar characteristics (recent or acute hiv-1 infection, subtype b predominance, mainly sexual mode of transmission), and similar method of tropism prediction (geno2pheno with 10% fpr). for instance, according to genotypic tropism testing performed on proviral dna in italy only 3% of patients with rhi were infected with x4 strains11, and in other studies the frequency of cxcr4-using strains among patients at early infection stages was under 20%5,12,15,16,17,53. the relatively high frequency of non-r5 strains determined in the current study for patients with rhi deserves attention because of the restricted number of patients eligible to therapy with ccr5 antagonist, maraviroc, as well as in the light of the established correlation between infection with the cxcr4-using strains and faster disease progression15,54, or first-line treatment failure19.although in current and other studies5,15,53,55,56 there were no significant differences between patients with rhi harbouring non-r5 and r5 viruses with regard to the baseline cd4+ t-cell count and viral load, longitudinal observations indicated that the presence of cxcr4-utilizing strains at the beginning of infection was associated with faster disease progression characterised by accelerated cd4+ t-cell count decline below 350 cells/μl5,53. besides, no significant differences in sex, age, ccr5 δ32 genotype, and hiv-1 subtype between patients with possible transmission of non-r5 and r5 strains were found in our research, confirming the results obtained in other studies15,53,57.in our study, non-r5 strains among patients with rhi were observed exclusively in msm, while patients with all other routes of hiv-1 transmission were harbouring r5 viruses. in some surveys addressing the issue of putative transmission of x4 strains to the new hosts, the route of hiv-1 transmission was similar among patients with r5 and x4 variants15,53,55,58, whereas in others, x4 viruses were more frequently detected in idus than in patients infected by sexual contacts5,56. in our study the number of rhi attributed to the transmission routes other than sex between men was very small, thus our ability to study the differences by transmission route was limited. nonetheless, our observations are consistent with prior research suggesting that proposed barriers protecting against x4 strains infection via blood and mucosal epithelium, and possibly selecting for r5 variants during transmission8 are similarly not perfect, and the spread of non-r5 and r5 strains may occur as a random process57.since detection of non-r5 strains among patients with rhi may reflect either the initial transmission of such strains or rapid evolution of x4 viruses from acquired r5 strains, to further address the issue of possible transmission of non-r5 strains to the new hosts among msm, the analysis of transmission clusters identified by phylogenetic approach was performed. among 11 patients with rhi and non-r5 strains, 5 had their hiv-1 sequences included within separate phylogenetic clusters indicating related transmission. only in one of these 5 clusters hiv-1 sequences presented different tropism (non-r5 and r5). these clustered sequences were derived from 2 patients with rhi, however, the patient with r5 strain infection entered the study over 4 years earlier than the patient harbouring non-r5 variant. thus, either he was not the immediate donor to the second patient, or he was not under successful treatment during 4 years after diagnosis. if the latter is true, it is possible that at the time of hiv-1 transmission, non-r5 variants could have emerged in the putative donor patient, initially infected with r5 virus, and could have been transmitted to a new host. unfortunately, we cannot confirm this assumption, since we have neither an additional, later sample from the patient with r5 strain infection nor additional clinical information. in the remaining 4 clusters the second patient involved in the same cluster (putative donor) was a person with lthi, also harbouring non-r5 strains, which may indicate the acquisition of non-r5 viruses, and the prevalence of acquired non-r5 hiv-1 infection confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis can be settled at 8.7% (4/46). studies in which the possibility of transmission of non-r5 strains was evaluated using phylogenetic clusters analysis are scarce, and give inconsistent results. frange et al.58 failed to confirm the transmission of non-r5 strains in the group of patients with primary hiv-1 infection, as only 1 out of 27 non-r5 sequences was present within a transmission cluster, and grouped with the sequence of an r5 strain obtained from a patient who was infected 34 months after infection of the presumed donor harbouring non-r5 virus. in turn, our data are congruent with the results presented by chalmet et al.57. in their study transmission of non-r5 strains was suggested by the presence of non-r5 sequences within common phylogenetic clusters, and was confirmed by the identification of non-r5 strains in both partners of well-recognised transmission pairs shortly after infection, supporting the hypothesis of random spread of strains presenting non-r5 or r5 tropism.the major limitation of our study is a relatively small sample size, hence we received small cluster sizes (mostly pairs) and some important transmission links could be omitted. although patients included in the analysis constituted an estimated sample of 16% of all new diagnoses detected in the studied provinces during study period, and such a sample is expected to be representative of the examined area, the interpretation of the transmission clusters in such a case should be performed with the extreme caution. especially, it should be considered that individuals who were not sampled can be either the intermediate hosts between patients with viral sequences gathered within the same cluster or the direct source of hiv-1 infection for them.another limitation of our study is linked to the years of samples collection, i.e. 2008–2014. while it is intrinsic to the similar types of studies that sampling considerably precedes the time of publication making the results significant for the earlier time periods38,39,45,59, we have tried to extend the validity of our study by conducting the time trends analyses.moreover, unlike in most other studies where pol hiv-1 sequences were used, we have used env gene sequences to detect phylogenetic transmission clusters, which complicates direct comparisons between studies. however, it was recently found that env sequences, due to their higher variability, may be more suitable than the pol sequences for analysis of recent infections59.finally, tropism predictions in our study were performed solely with the genotypic methods. although genotypic tropism testing is currently accepted as an alternative to the phenotypic testing47,60, and >80% concordance between phenotypic assays and the geno2pheno method used for subtype b tropism assessment was reported51,61,62,63,64,65, it was shown that detection of cxcr4-using viruses by some genotypic assays may be inaccurate, especially for non-b subtypes61,66,67. thus, to predict the tropism in non-b hiv-1 samples we used phenoseq, a tool with improved sensitivity and specificity for establishing the tropism of non-b subtypes68. nevertheless, the discrepant results of the genotypic and phenotypic tropism assays were reported for patients with acute or recent infections5,13,14,16, indicating that our tropism predictions should be interpreted with caution.in conclusion , we found relatively high prevalence of non-r5 strains among polish patients with new hiv-1 diagnoses (23%) and recent infections (24%), but we did not confirm the increasing trend for the frequency of non-r5 viruses among newly diagnosed individuals reported in a former polish study. transmission of non-r5 viruses was confirmed by cluster analysis for 8.7% (4/46) patients with rhi. non-r5 strain distribution and recent hiv-1 infection frequency, as well as the prevalence of non-b subtypes in poland may differ by geographic region. although viral sequences obtained from individuals with rhi were notably more frequent within the transmission clusters than outside them, the participation of these individuals in the forward hiv-1 transmission was not confirmed.methodsstudy group and sample collectionthe study was performed among 298 consecutive polish patients who were recruited under the following inclusion criteria: (1) being newly diagnosed with hiv-1 infection, and having no clinical aids (indicator disease) at first testing; (2) presenting at 1 of 4 centers for hiv diagnostics and therapy for aids in poland placed in chorzów, kraków, łódź, and wrocław, during the enrolment period, between march 2008 and february 2014; (3) having their blood sample collected at first presentation; and (4) providing written informed consent to participate in the study. during the recruitment procedure the data regarding sex, age, date and city of hiv-1 diagnosis, as well as self-reported transmission route were collected. viral load and cd4+ t-lymphocyte at hiv-1 diagnosis were retrieved from patients’ medical records and were the first results obtained after hiv-1 diagnosis. anticoagulated venous blood and plasma samples were collected at first clinical presentation and were stored at –80 °c until further laboratory procedures were performed.all plasma samples were tested with the quantitative limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (sediatm hiv-1 lag-avidity eia, sedia biosciences corporation, portland, oregon, usa) to differentiate recent from long-term hiv-1 infections. assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol69. as recommended, samples with normalized median optical density values (odn) ≤ 1.5 in a triplicate confirmatory testing were considered to be obtained from persons with recent hiv-1 infection, which corresponds to a duration of hiv-1 infection no longer than 130 days (95% ci: 118–142) since seroconversion70.qiaamp dna blood mini kit (qiagen gmbh, hilden, germany) was used to extract genomic and proviral dna from blood samples. the presence of 32 base-pair deletion in patients’ ccr5 gene (δ32) was determined with the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as described previously10,71.amplification and sequencing of hiv-1 env geneamplification of env gene fragments coding for gp120 region was performed with nested-pcr in 298 samples of genomic and proviral dna obtained from 47 patients with recent hiv-1 infection (rhi), and 251 persons with long-term infection (lthi). in the first step of the nested-pcr, fragment spanning nucleotides 6201–9089 was amplified using e00-f and e01-r as outer primers72, with the following amplification conditions: an initial denaturation at 94 °c/7 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °c/40 seconds, 51 °c/40 seconds, and 72 °c/3 minutes, with the final extension at 72 °c/7 minutes, in a final volume of 50 μl. in the next step, inner primers ed5-f and e125-r were used to obtain 782 base pairs fragment of gp120 spanning nucleotides 6557-733872,73. amplification conditions for inner primer pairs were as follows: 94 °c/5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °c/35 seconds, 55 °c/35 seconds, and 72 °c/90 seconds, with the final extension at 72 °c/5 minutes, in a final volume of 50 μl.purified nested-pcr products were subjected to the population-based sequencing with the abi prism big dye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) with the primers used in the inner step of nested-pcr. for each sample, the sequences of both strands were determined separately using 96-capillary 3730xl dna analyzer (applied biosystems, usa). the obtained sequences were manually checked and trimmed to remove primers, resulting in fragments spanning nucleotides from 6583 to 7314 corresponding to codons 121–363 of gp120, covering the complete coding sequence for v1, v2, c2 and v3 regions. nucleotides were considered ambiguous, when the next highest peak in the electropherogram exceeded 25% of the main peak. all nucleotide positions in the manuscript are presented according to the numbering positions of hiv-1 hxb2 (genbank accession number: k03455). amplification and sequencing was successful for 292 specimens, including 46 originated from patients with rhi.analysis of hiv-1 env sequences and coreceptor usage predictionall sequences were analysed for the presence of hypermutations using hypermut software v2.074. hiv-1 subtypes were initially determined with rega hiv-1 subtyping tool 3.0 (http://dbpartners.stanford.edu:8080/regasubtyping/stanford-hiv/typingtool), and afterward with ncbi genotyping tool using hiv-1 reference set from 2009 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi). the ncbi genotyping tool analyses were performed especially to check sequences determined as non-b or not assigned to any subtype by rega tool. to confirm subtype identification by rega and ncbi genotyping tools, phylogenetic analysis with phyml 3.0 online software was conducted75. reference hiv-1 sequences of known genotype (subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (crfs)), that were used in phylogenetic analysis, were retrieved from los alamos national laboratory hiv sequence database’s compendium from the year 2016 (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/newalign/align.html). phylogenetic tree for all examined and reference sequences was created in the phyml 3.0 with the maximum likelihood (ml) method under the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model + gamma distribution of rates + proportion of invariable sites (gtr + g + i) with the gamma shape parameter and proportion of invariable sites estimated from data (supplementary fig. s1). tree topology was improved with both nni (nearest neighbor interchange) and spr (subtree pruning and regrafting) algorithms. subsequently, all examined sequences were evaluated for recombination with the jumping profile hidden markov model (jphmm, http://jphmm.gobics.de/submission_hiv)76.to determine hiv-1 coreceptor usage, all single proviral dna env sequences coding for a v3 loop were analysed with the online geno2pheno algorithm (http://coreceptor.geno2pheno.org/index.php)77, which is one of the most widely accepted and used methods for genotypic prediction of viral tropism. in accordance with the current recommendations47 and results of prospective studies11,12,78, a false positive rate (fpr) of 10% was used to interpret the clonal geno2pheno’s results, thus viruses were classified as non-r5 when v3 sequences displayed an fpr value ≤ 10%, (10% probability of classifying an r5 virus falsely as x4). since the sensitivity of the geno2pheno method to detect x4 variants was shown to be lower for non-b subtypes than for subtype b67, sequences representing subtypes other than b were tested with phenoseq program, which is a newer tool developed to reliably predict the tropism of hiv-1 variants such as a, b, c, d, crf01_ae and crf02_ag (http://tools.burnet.edu.au/phenoseq/)68.geno2pheno algorithm with fpr of 5.75 was also used to improve the specificity, and higher fpr values (of 15% and 20%) were applied to increase the sensitivity for detection of non-r5 variants.the number of ambiguous nucleotides in the obtained v3 coding fragments ranged from 0 to 7, thus all 292 v3 sequences could be included in the genotypic tropism predictions, since it is not recommended to consider the v3 sequences with ≥8 ambiguous nucleotides in a coreceptor usage testing47.phylogenetic analyses and identification of clustered hiv-1 env sequencesprior to phylogenetic analyses clustalx algorithm was used to align 292 env sequences together with group m consensus sequence79. the alignment was manually edited using the bioedit program80, and columns with gaps were removed. the gtr + g + i was selected as the best fitting nucleotide substitution model according to the akaike and bayesian information criterions (aic, bic) implemented in the jmodeltest 2.1.9 software81. under this model the nucleotide frequencies were: a = 0.4243, c = 0.1988, g = 0.1723, t = 0.2046; the substitution rates were: ac = 1.2416, ag = 3.9991, at = 0.7674, cg = 0.5556, ct = 3.7929, gt = 1.0000; proportion of invariant = 0.165; and gamma shape parameter = 0.776.initially, transmission clusters were investigated with the phyml 3.0 software75 using maximum likelihood (ml) method, under the selected gtr + g + i model, with the best of nni and spr algorithms for tree topology improvement. to evaluate branch supports of a phylogeny approximate likelihood ratio test (alrt) values with nonparametric shimodaira–hasegawa–like (sh–like) algorithm were computed in the phyml 3.0. the resulting ml phylogenetic tree and aligned sequence data were analysed with the cluster picker 1.2.5 software to identify monophyletic clusters based on specified thresholds for maximum pairwise genetic distances and alrt support values82.additionally, a more robust bayesian metropolis coupled markov chain monte carlo (mcmcmc) method was used to further verify the clusters. two independent replicates of 50 million generations were run in mrbayes v.3.2.683 with sample frequency of 2500, under gtr + g + i model. a burn-in of 25% was used to summarize parameters and trees in the bayesian approach. to control whether a sample from the posterior probability distribution was adequate, a plot of the generation vs the log probability was checked. the total effective sample size (ess) values were above 200 for all parameters, average standard deviation of split frequencies decreased below 0.01 after 11.9 million generations, and potential scale reduction factors (psrfs) were reasonably close to 1.0 indicating appropriate convergence. finally, transmission clusters were identified when the following criteria were simultaneously met: i) alrt value in ml method >0.9, ii) maximum within cluster pairwise genetic distance calculated in the cluster picker <3%, and iii) posterior probability in a bayesian inference = 1. such clusters are assumed to represent related transmission events between patients whose viral sequences are gathered within a single cluster. phylogenetic trees were visualized in figtree v.1.4.3.sequence dataall of the hiv-1 nucleotide sequences obtained in the study have been deposited in genbank with the kt778123-kt778247 and mh627052-mh627218 accession numbers.statistical analysiscomparisons of categorical variables between specified groups were performed with the pearson’s chi-square test. two-tailed fisher’s exact test was applied for binary variables and for variables with several possible categories to compare a specified category vs all other categories. the nonparametric mann-whitney u test was used for analysis of continuous variables. to examine the time trends in selected parameters, logistic and linear regression analyses with the year of hiv-1 diagnosis as a single predictor were performed for binary and continuous outcome variables, respectively. for the continuous outcome variables we present the slope of the linear effect of the diagnosis year. for the binary variables odds ratios per each additional year are provided. for greater comparability, for the binary variables we also calculated average prevalence differences per year (average annual difference), by fitting linear regression model to annual average prevalences. all statistical analyses were performed using statistica v13.1 enriched with a medical set (statsoft, warsaw, poland), with the significance level defined by p < 0.05.ethical approvalthe research was approved by the national institute of public health – national institute of hygiene bioethics committee, poland (no. 3/2007), and all procedures were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. all collected samples and data were anonymous and coded. written informed consent was obtained from study participants.

HIV infection and latency induce a unique metabolic signature in human macrophages,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39898-5,Research,8 March 2019,yes,"currently, a major barrier to curing hiv infection is the generation of tissue-associated, non-replicating, long-lasting viral reservoirs that are refractory to therapy and can be reactivated upon anti-retroviral therapy interruption. one of these reservoirs are latently hiv-infected macrophages. here, we show that hiv infection of macrophages results in survival of a small population of infected cells that are metabolically altered and characterized by mitochondrial fusion, lipid accumulation, and reduced mitochondrial atp production. no changes in glycolysis were detected. metabolic analysis indicated an essential role of succinate and other tca metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle in mediating lipid accumulation and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) in the mitochondria. furthermore, we show that while uninfected and hiv infected macrophages use fatty acids and glucose as primary sources of energy, surviving hiv infected macrophages also use glutamine/glutamate as a major energy source, and blocking these new sources of energy resulted in the killing of latent hiv infected macrophages. together, our data provide a new understanding of the formation, properties, and potential novel ways to eliminate macrophage viral reservoirs.
introduction a key feature of hiv infection that has made it virtually impossible to truly cure this disease is the generation of latent viral reservoirs in different tissues. a viral reservoir corresponds to long-lived infected cells, mainly localized in a specific anatomical compartment, where the replication-competent virus can persist for a longer time than the main pool of actively replicating virus1,2,3,4. one of these reservoirs is hiv infected macrophages, which are terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells derived from circulating monocytes that reside in all tissues5. it is widely accepted that in addition to t cells, monocyte/macrophage lineage cells are among the first cells targeted by hiv6 and these cells then allow the virus to spread rapidly by transmission to cd4+ t cells7,8,9. furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that macrophages could sustain hiv replication in vivo in the absence of t cells, supporting the hypothesis that macrophages are a primary target of hiv and may help transmit the infection to other cell types even in the absence of cd4+ t lymphocytes1,10.although hiv infection kills most cd4+ t cells, a small population of hiv infected macrophages survives for extended periods by harboring the virus in cell membrane invaginations that protect virions from antiretroviral treatment (art) and circulating neutralizing antibodies11,12,13. under inflammatory conditions, macrophages derived from recently transmigrated monocytes die after few days14, whereas microglia, perivascular, and alveolar macrophages can survive for long periods – from weeks to years15,16,17. the properties of mobility, capacity for tissue infiltration, and extended survival have been proposed by several groups to be critical for the role of macrophages in the generation, stability, dissemination, and reactivation of hiv reservoirs. however, the mechanisms by which these latently hiv-infected cells become viral reservoirs and survive for extended periods of time are unknown.we have characterized the metabolic profile of latently hiv-infected macrophages and identified several unique metabolic features of these cells. first, hiv infection had a profound overall silencing effect on mitochondrial metabolism. second, in latently infected macrophages the metabolic steps in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle preceding oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) were compromised, resulting in lipid accumulation, which is typically observed in several tissues and cells in the hiv infected population18,19. in addition to fatty acid and glucose, latent hiv-reservoirs relied on glutamine, glutamate, and alpha-ketoglutarate (α-kg) as a major source of energy. finally, blocking the use of glutamine, glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate pathways resulted in a significant killing of the latent hiv infected macrophages. these results reveal a unique metabolic signature of hiv infected macrophages that is similar to the observed in aggressive types of brain cancer, especially in glioblastoma20,21,22. we demonstrated that targeting specific metabolic pathways of viral reservoirs is a promising therapeutic approach to eradicate viral reservoirs in hiv infected individuals.resultshiv infection of macrophages results in massive early apoptosis, the survival of a small population of hiv infected cells, and mitochondrial enlargementas we previously described, acute hiv infection of human primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages results in massive apoptosis; however, a small population of hiv-infected cells survive and become latently infected23,24,25,26,27,28,29. despite these findings, hiv infection of macrophages is controversial in a few scientific circles. there are multiple lines of evidence supporting macrophage infection and pathogenesis in an independent manner than hiv replication on t cells10,23,30,31. in addition, we recently reported that apoptosis induced by hiv in human macrophages follows an unusual apoptotic pathway with no significant changes in multiple apoptotic proteins, but a significant increase in the protein bim, probably to block the formation of the apoptosome23. bim, a highly apoptotic protein, is recruited to the mitochondria without resulting in apoptosis23, suggesting that in hiv surviving cells, mitochondrial function is compromised. furthermore, we identify in the current study that bcl-2, mcl-1, and hsp-70 and-27 are not affected during the entire time course of the infection (supplemental fig. 1), supporting the essential role of bim in the mitochondria, and not other apoptotic proteins, in the context of hiv.as we described, three different stages of viral replication in human macrophages could be observed (fig. 1a and supplemental fig. 2). an early stage (1–3 days post-infection) characterized by increasing hiv replication (fig. 1 a, hiv early) with ∼50% of the cells with integrated hiv dna into the host dna (fig. 1b, white bars, early). also at this time point, expression of hiv nef mrna was detected in ∼50% of the cells (fig. 1b, early, black bars), and ∼50% of the cells expressed significant amounts of hiv-p24 protein (fig. 1b, early, gray bars). all these analyses were performed using the simultaneous detection of integrated hiv dna, viral mrna, and viral proteins as we recently described in detail32. quantification of the staining for integrated hiv dna (black line), viral mrna (red line), and viral proteins (blue line) indicates that hiv-dna staining remains stable early, mid, and late stages post infection (fig. 1c). viral mrna intensity decreased at the mid-stage indicating a silencing of the viral mrna expression at the later stages post infection (fig. 1c). moreover, the expression of hiv-p24 protein reached a peak at the early stages of infection and remained stable until the later stages post infection, indicating that hiv-p24 protein is stable, despite the decay in hiv mrna expression (fig. 1c). all these data together indicate that viral replication becomes silent at the late stages of hiv infection in the few macrophages that survive hiv infection. quantification of the apoptosis indicates that an early stage (1–3 days post-infection), where 12.36 ± 6.45% of the cells were undergoing apoptosis and 16.1 ± 13.83% of the surviving cells were positive for hiv-p24 (fig. 1a–d, and23). a mid-stage (7–14 days) was characterized by higher viral replication (fig. 1a), high cell death (79.97 ± 13.65%; fig. 1c,d), which mainly affected uninfected macrophages (23, fig. 1a–d, “cell death”), and a high percentage of alive cells positive for hiv-p24 (62.98 ± 11.99%; fig. 1d). the late stages of viral replication (14–21 days) were characterized by minimal to undetectable hiv replication and cell death numbers similar to the mid-stage (82.65 ± 8.94%, fig. 1d), resulting in the survival of a small population of hiv infected macrophages that were not producing virus (although 93.15 ± 2.95% of the surviving cells were infected. fig. 1d), also named viral reservoirs (fig. 1a–c, *p ≤ 0.0021 as compared to uninfected conditions (“control”), #p = 0.0001 as compared to early and mid stages of replication, see representative examples in supplemental fig. 2). as expected, no viral replication or unspecific staining was detected in uninfected cells (“control,” fig. 1a, n = 8).figure 1a small population of hiv infected macrophages survives infection and shows mitochondrial compromise. pbmcs were isolated from leukopacks provided by the ny blood center. macrophages were isolated by adherence in the presence of m-csf for 7 dpi. cultures were exposed to 50 ng/ml of hivada for 24 h, washed, and maintained for 3, 7, 14, and 21 dpi for subsequent analysis. (a) hiv replication as determined by hiv-p24 elisa in the supernatant of uninfected (control) and hiv infected macrophage cultures (early, mid, and late). hiv at the late stages becomes silent. hiv dna staining and alu-pcr confirmed these results. (b) staining for hiv integrated dna (nef), viral mrna (nef) and hiv-p24 protein and subsequent analysis for microscopy. we quantified the % of positive cells at the early, mid, and late stage, indicating that at later time points, viral mrna and protein expression is decreased in the cells. (c) however, quantification of the staining in b, indicates that integrated hiv dna remains stable, viral mrna decreased at the late stages, and hiv-p24 remain stable from the mid stages. (d) percentage of cell death in uninfected (control conditions) and hiv infected conditions (hiv). hiv infection induces a large amount of cell death, but early on a population of hiv-p24 positive cells survive the infection. in parenthesis is the % of hiv infected cells. (e,f) correspond to representative pictures of transmission electron microscopy (tem) of macrophages in control conditions (uninfected, ui) and hiv infected cells (hiv) to observe the distribution, numbers, and size of mitochondria. (g) quantification of mitochondrial size (nm2) per area. *p = 0.0341, n = 7.full size imageanalysis of the surviving cells in the hiv-infected cultures by transmission electron microscopy (tem) demonstrated that mitochondria in the surviving hiv infected cells had become bigger (fig. 1f) as compared to uninfected cells (fig. 1e). a similar pattern of mitochondrial enlargement, or fusion, has been observed in different cell types during serum starvation and autophagy conditions33,34,35. quantification of mitochondrial size demonstrated that mitochondria increased significantly in size after seven days post-infection (fig. 1g, *p = 0.0341 as compared to uninfected conditions, ui, n = 7). these results were hiv specific and did not replicate using different cell densities or cell activation using cytokines including tnf-α and/or ifn-γ (data not shown). intriguingly, western blot and immunofluorescence analysis did not show any significant difference in expression or localization of mitofusin-1 and-2 (supplemental fig. 3), as had been described in autophagy33,34,35, indicating that the mechanism of mitochondrial enlargement upon hiv infection is different than in autophagy.mitochondria in surviving hiv infected macrophages are functionalto determine whether the mitochondria in the hiv surviving cells are functional, we measured their relative membrane potential using a ratio between tom20 and mitotracker. tom20 staining was not affected by changes in membrane potential (green staining). however, uptake of mitotracker redcmxros, which is taken up by a translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane, is membrane potential-dependent (red staining). we also stained actin using phalloidin staining (white staining) to identify the cell shape. in uninfected cells (ui), as expected, there was a perfect colocalization of tom20 and mitotracker (supplemental fig. 4a). however, in hiv infected cultures, the cells that survived infection showed a loss of colocalization and decreased mitotracker staining (supplemental fig. 4a, hiv). quantification of the tom20 staining indicated that there was no loss of this protein in uninfected or hiv infected conditions (supplemental fig. 4b). overall, no changes in membrane potential or mitotracker staining were observed among uninfected or hiv infected cells (supplemental fig. 4c). however, further analysis of hiv fused cells indicated a reduced mean intensity of mitotracker per cell or per nuclei (supplemental fig. 4d) and tom20 (supplemental fig. 4e) (*p = 0.0003, n = 6). moreover, the ratio of mitotracker/tom20 remained stable. these data indicate that upon cell to cell fusion due to hiv infection, only a small population of mitochondria was compromised; however, overall mitochondrial potential and numbers were maintained during the time course of infection, especially in surviving hiv infected cells.surviving hiv infected macrophages have reduced overall mitochondrial function but maintain their stress responseto determine whether hiv targets mitochondrial metabolism during different stages of hiv infection of human primary macrophages, we measured their oxygen consumption rate (ocr) using a seahorse analyzer (agilent technologies, santa clara, ca) to determine basal respiration, atp production, proton leak, maximal respiration, and mitochondrial spare capacity (see details, https://www.agilent.com/en-us/products/cell-analysis-(seahorse)/mitochondrial-respiration-the-xf-cell-mito-stress-test).as indicated in fig. 2a during the early stage of infection (1–3 days post-infection), the basal ocr was reduced by approximately 20–30%, indicating that early events of hiv infection impacted mitochondrial respiration without changing maximal respiration or spare capacity (fig. 2a,e). at the mid-stage, where apoptotic levels were high (fig. 2b,e), we observed a reduction in total ocr that strongly correlated with cell death (fig. 2b). at the late time points post-infection, where most remaining cells were hiv infected surviving cells, no further changes in the ocr were detected (fig. 2c,d, amplification of 2 c). quantification of these data confirmed that hiv infection compromises basal ocr (*p = 0.0194, n = 6), as well as response to oligomycin (fig. 2f, &, p = 0.0033, n = 3; #p = 0.00009, n = 3), but does not affect fccp or spare respiratory capacity (fig. 2g,h, respectively). there was a significant difference in oligomycin response in hiv infected cells compared to uninfected cells early and late during infection, but not during the mid stages, suggesting that during periods of minimal apoptosis, atp-linked respiration is reduced by the virus (fig. 2f). these differences in the metabolic profile were not due to the differences in cell number, because subconfluent cultures also have similar behavior to confluent cultures (data not shown). activation of human macrophages with tnf-α plus ifn-γ did not result in similar metabolic changes (data not shown). thus metabolic changes are associated with the hiv infection specifically and not due to general immune activation.figure 2hiv infection reduces the basal ocr in surviving cells. to determine the function of the mitochondria in the population of surviving cells, the ocr (oxygen consumption rate) was determined. oxygen consumption by complex iv is generally accepted as the main source of oxygen consumption in cells (see the cartoon in i). in these experiments, complex iv activity can be inhibited by antimycin a (a), and rotenone (r) can shut down complex i activity. using both inhibitors will completely shut down all etc activity. complex v activity can be shut down using oligomycin (o), which will thereby shut down all atp generated by oxphos. the maximal capabilities of mitochondrial etc function are analyzed by the use of fccp, an inducer of inner membrane pore formation that dissipates the chemical gradient between the intermembrane space and the matrix. the seahorse xfp analyzer takes advantage of a sensitive oxygen meter to measure oxygen consumption rates (ocr) in response to the treatments described above. (a) determination of basal respiration, atp production, maximal respiration and spare capacity using oligomycin, fccp, and antimycin a plus rotenone, respectively. early during infection, there was a reduction in the basal ocr before o treatment. ocr determinations at the mid (b) or late stage of infection (c).

(g) quantification of coupling efficiency in response to fccp. (h) quantification of spare respiratory capacity. (i) a diagram showing the site of action of each inhibitor.full size imagehiv induced mitochondrial compromise is not due to changes in the expression of mitochondrial complexestypically, changes in ocr are associated with changes in oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), most specifically complexes i to v36,37,38. to determine whether hiv infection altered the expression of these complexes, qrt-pcr and western blots were performed. no differences in mrna expression were found between uninfected, and hiv infected conditions (supplemental fig. 5a, n = 7). results obtained from mrna amplification of complex v were inconclusive (data not shown). western blots for complexes i to v indicated no significant differences in expression of all complexes at different stages of infection (supplemental fig. 5b,c, n = 5). thus, hiv-induced changes in mitochondrial shape, basal ocr, and response to oligomycin were not due to changes in mrna or protein expression related to mitochondrial fusion, as has been described for other diseases33,34,35, indicating that hiv uses a different mechanism to survive infection and/or evade apoptosis.glycolysis is not affected by hiv infectionto determine whether the changes in metabolism observed in hiv infected macrophages were due to alterations in glycolysis, extracellular acidification rate (ecar) was assessed at different time points after hiv infection (i.e., the early, mid and late stages – fig. 3a–c, respectively). overall, there were no differences in ecar in any condition or in response to injection of glucose (g), oligomycin (o), or 2 deoxy-d-glucose (2dg) (see the cartoon in fig. 3f). these data indicate that glycolysis was not affected by hiv infection in macrophages. interestingly, a similar glycolytic response was found in the few cells that survived hiv infection and silenced the virus as compared to uninfected cells (fig. 3d). no changes in oligomycin response were detected in ecar (fig. 3e), supporting the conclusion  that the metabolic effects of hiv are in the mitochondria and not on the glycolytic pathways. this is a significant difference from circulating viral reservoirs, which express increased amounts of glut-1 and show elevated glycolysis39,40,41,42,43,44. thus, the metabolism of latently hiv infected macrophages is different from that in t cell viral reservoirs.figure 3hiv infection did not alter glycolysis. uninfected (ui) and hiv infected cultures (hiv) at different stages were subjected to ecar, extracellular acidification rate measurement, and seahorse analysis to examine glycolysis. we injected glucose (g), oligomycin (o), and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dg). treatment with glucose increases ecar, while subsequent injection with oligomycin forces cells to use only lactic acid fermentation for atp production and further increases ecar. inhibition with 2dg completely shuts down any atp production from glycolysis and thus reduces ecar. (a) changes in ecar during early stages; (b) mid-stages, and (c) late stages. (d) corresponds to an amplification of the hiv infected curve shown in c. (e) corresponds to the % change in ecar in response to oligomycin during all stages of infection. no significant changes were observed. (f) represents the blocking stage of 2dg.full size imagelipid droplets accumulate in surviving hiv infected macrophages and associate with enlarged mitochondrialipid dysregulation is a well-documented problem in the hiv infected population, and it is mostly associated with foam macrophages (uninfected and hiv infected) that survive for extended periods of time, resulting in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and dementia45,46,47,48. to determine whether the changes in mitochondrial fusion and metabolism are due to alterations in lipid metabolism, bodipy staining was performed at different stages post infection. our data indicate that hiv infection of human macrophages results in significant accumulation of lipids in the macrophages that survive hiv infection, especially in the fused macrophages (fig. 4a). quantification of lipid accumulation using confocal microscopy indicated that hiv fused cells accumulate more lipids than uninfected and single hiv infected cells (fig. 4b, *p = 0.00230, n = 6). lipid accumulation was not due to the cell to cell fusion due that calibration of the numbers of lipid bodies per nuclei was insignificant (fig. 4c, hiv fused). however, examination of hiv-infected surviving cells using electron microscopy indicates that lipid distribution was altered. under hiv conditions, mitochondria (m) become bigger (fig. 1f) and closely associated with lipid droplets. activation of human macrophages with tnf-α plus ifn-γ did not result in a similar metabolic profile (data not shown). thus, these metabolic changes are again associated with the hiv infection and not due to general immune activation. these data indicate that hiv surviving cells accumulate lipids and direct lipid droplets to areas rich in enlarged mitochondria.figure 4hiv infection increased lipid accumulation and interaction of lipids with the mitochondria. cells were fixed with 4% pfa but not permeabilized to prevent lipid loss. next, cells were stained with dapi, bodipy, and phalloidin to label nuclei, lipids, and actin, respectively. (a) a representative example of uninfected (ui) and hiv infected (hiv) macrophage cultures staining used to measure lipid production at the late stage of infection. (b) quantification of lipid staining intensity indicates that hiv fused cells had a higher amount of lipids as compared to uninfected cells (ui) or hiv unfused cells (hiv single). *p = 0.0230, n = 6. (c) quantification of lipids per nucleus was normalized to the number of nuclei per cell, with no significant difference per nucleus between uninfected cultures and hiv infected cultures. (d,e) showing two different examples of proliferating and fused mitochondria (m) and their close interaction with lipid droplets (ld), see the arrow.full size imagetricarboxylic acid metabolites generated prior to the mitochondrial steps are key metabolites in lipid accumulation and tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle dysregulationour data so far indicate no changes in glycolysis, increased lipid accumulation, and reduced oxphos reliance, suggesting that the tca cycle is compromised and may provide a stable alternative source of energy in addition to glucose, such as lipids. furthermore, the increase in lipids indicates that there is an additional source of carbons to accumulate large lipid bodies. therefore, we hypothesized that an additional source of carbon was contributing to the tca cycle to fuel lipid accumulation and oxphos function. to test this idea, we treated cultures of human macrophages with different concentrations of succinate (1, 10 and 100 µm, a metabolite generated prior to the oxphos steps), and lipid accumulation was determined by confocal microscopy and ocr quantifications. addition of succinate to uninfected cultures did not change lipid abundance at any concentration tested (control, fig. 5a).figure 5succinate and α-kg are key tca intermediates in lipid accumulation. (a) representative examples of control and (b) hiv infected macrophages in untreated (0 µm) and treated with 1, 10, and 100 µm succinate and stained with bodipy (lipid, green stain), dapi (nuclei, blue stain), and actin (cyan stain). (c) measurement of bodipy staining per cell quantified using nikon elements software. control (ui) cells did not respond to succinate treatment. single cells in hiv infected cultures accumulated lipids in a dose dependent manner according to increased concentration of succinate (hiv single, #p = 0.0002). fused hiv infected macrophages accumulated lipids in response to succinate treatment. *p ≤ 0.0230, n = 4 different individuals. (d) a representative example of an ocr response curve in response to 50 µm succinate (s), 500 µm malonate (m), 0.5 µm rotenone, and 0.5 µm antimycin-a (a). (e) quantification of the ocr change in uninfected and hiv infected macrophages. only changes in antimycin a response were found to be significant (*p = 0.0045, n = 7). (f) the cartoon represents a summary of the data and the proposed hypothesis of how lipids are accumulated in hiv infected macrophages. red letters indicate our data. purple letters indicate the affected areas supported by our data. blue letters indicate the areas probably involved in lipid accumulation, but not tested in this study.full size imagein contrast, succinate treatment of hiv infected cultures of macrophages increased lipid accumulation at all concentrations tested (fig. 5b, representative images). quantification of bodipy staining confirmed that succinate treatment of uninfected cultures did not alter lipid loading (fig. 5c, ui). overall, hiv infection increased lipid accumulation (combination of hiv single cells + hiv fused cells, fig. 5c), but most of the lipid loading was observed in hiv fused macrophages, which are the cells that survive infection and silence viral replication (fig. 5c, *p = 0.0023 as compared to ui cells, n = 4).furthermore, ocr determinations in response to succinate, malonate, and rotenone demonstrated no differences between uninfected and hiv infected conditions, with the ocr recovering to control levels. the only difference observed was response to antimycin a, an inhibitor of complex iv, which demonstrates a difference in oxphos function associated with complex iv (fig. 5e, *p = 0.0045, n = 7). activation of human macrophages with tnf-α plus ifn-γ did not result in similar metabolic changes (data not shown), indicating these metabolic changes are associated with the hiv infection and not due to general immune activation. together, these results show that hiv reservoirs have a compromised tca cycle and oxphos system, with the accumulating lipids possibly serving as an additional source of energy to support the minimal loss in ocr function (see fig. 5f).hiv reservoirs use glutamine/glutamate as an alternative fuel source to generate energynormally, cells use glucose and fatty acids as a major source of energy; however, in pathological conditions, such as neuro/glioblastoma and other types of cancer, amino acids such as glutamine are used as fuel sources, mainly to avoid a dependency on carbon sources from the bloodstream49,50,51. critically, glutamine/glutamate can provide additional energy to the tca cycle by providing extra alpha-ketoglutarate (α-kg) and succinate as shown in fig. 6a. thus, to determine whether glutamate/glutamine could provide an additional source of carbon to the tca cycle, single fuel dependency was determined. we measured oxphos by inhibiting fatty acid contribution to the tca with etomoxir (fatty acid oxidation inhibitor), uk5099 (glucose oxidation inhibitor), or bptes (glutaminase inhibitor) as described in fig. 6a. addition of one inhibitor at a time (single fuel dependency, fig. 6b) showed that uninfected macrophages mostly used fatty acids and glucose to produce atp (ui, fig. 6b). as expected, minimal to undetectable use of glutamine as a source of energy was found in uninfected conditions (fig. 6b, ui, glutamine). in hiv infected macrophages, while fatty acids and glucose were still utilized, the contribution of glutamine sources significantly increased (fig. 6b, hiv, glutamine, *p = 0.0001, n = 4). these data indicate that hiv infected macrophages that survive infection behave similarly to cancer cells treated with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide, bptes, an inhibitor of glutaminase52. also, activation of human macrophages with tnf-α plus ifn-γ did not result in similar metabolic changes indicating that this phenotype is unique (data not shown). thus metabolic changes are associated with the hiv infection and not due to general immune activation. furthermore, the changes in glutamine/glutamate/α-kg dependency were associated with higher expression of glutaminase and glutamine synthetase (data not shown). therefore, like cancer cells, hiv infected cells that survive infection use particular amino acid pathways as a significant source of energy.figure 6hiv infection regulates the metabolism of latently infected macrophages. (a) diagram of mitochondrial fuel input from glycolytic, glutamine, and fatty acid pathways, with appropriate inhibitors used to prevent the usage of these pathways. (b) ocr changes used to measure percentage dependency of one or two fuel types. ocr changes are measured at baseline (no compounds) for roughly 17 minutes, followed by injection of one fuel inhibitor for single fuel dependency, or with two inhibitors for double fuel dependency. ocr changes resulting from treatment are measured for approximately 40 minutes, followed by injection of the remaining two fuels for single fuel dependency experiments, or the single remaining fuel for double dependency measurements. dependency for single and double fuel experiments is calculated as the percentage change from baseline due to the first injection. (b) mitochondrial oxphos dependency on fatty acid, glutamine, and glucose. hiv infected macrophages were more dependent on glutamine than their uninfected counterparts (*p = 0.0001, n = 4). there was no significant change in dependency on fatty acid or glucose for oxphos during hiv infection. there was a significant dependence on fatty acids for oxphos in uninfected and hiv infected cells compared to glutamine and glucose (#p ≤ 0.0119). (c) analysis of mitochondrial dependence on two fuel types for oxphos. when forced to use a single fuel source for oxphos, there was a significant decrease in the ability for hiv macrophages to use fatty acids and glucose, and a significant increase in the ability to use glutamine (*p ≤ 0.0002). single and double dependency experiments indicate that uninfected macrophages are flexible to shift among several types of energy sources. however, hiv infected macrophages have an increased “flexibility” to shift among these forms of energy. (d) to evaluate whether the use of glutamine, glutamate, and α-kg is necessary for the survival of hiv reservoirs, we treated uninfected and hiv infected cultures of surviving macrophages with bptes or benzylserine. both inhibitors did not alter the survival of uninfected cultures. however, the combination of both or benzylserine alone resulted in significant cell death in the hiv infected cells. all points are significant after two days post-treatment (n = 4, p ≤ 0.005).full size imagehiv reservoirs gain the flexibility to shift between different sources of energyto assess the flexibility of uninfected and hiv infected cells to shift among different sources of energy, we determined the capacity of cells to use either fatty acids, glutamine, or glucose alone by blocking two major sources of energy at a time. if the cells were exclusively reliant on the two inhibited fuel sources, we expected to observe a drop in ocr. in contrast, if the cells were capable of using the remaining fuel source, then there should be little to no change in the ocr.fuel reliance on cells under hiv conditions was significantly altered compared to uninfected cells (fig. 6c, *p ≤ 0.0002). if we simultaneously inhibited glucose and glutamine oxidation using a cocktail of etomoxir and uk5099, thus requiring cells to use fatty acids, the ocr change in uninfected cells was negligible (fig. 6c, fatty acid, ui, black bar). these data indicate that uninfected macrophages can use fatty acids as a fuel source for oxphos, and is consistent with our observation that macrophages are dependent on fatty acids more than other fuel types (fig. 6a, fatty acid compared to glutamine and glucose). however, hiv infected macrophages were even more capable of further using fatty acids as a fuel source when it was the only fuel source available (fig. 6c, fatty acid, hiv, red bar).when we simultaneously inhibited glucose and fatty acid oxidation using a cocktail of uk5099 and etomoxir, we observed that uninfected macrophages could not use glutamine for oxphos (fig. 6c, glutamine, ui, black bar), indicating their strong dependence upon fatty acid and glucose for oxphos. in contrast, when hiv infected macrophages were assessed, they showed the ability to use glutamine as fuel for oxphos when the other sources were unavailable (fig. 6c, glutamine, red bar). if fatty acid and glutamine dependency were blocked, uninfected and hiv infected cells were able to increase their reliance on glucose (fig. 6c, glucose, red bar).based on the increased dependency on glutamine in surviving hiv infected macrophages, we hypothesized that survival of these cells was also dependent on glutamine, glutamate, and α-kg metabolism. to demonstrate that, we treated late stage surviving macrophages, uninfected and hiv infected, with bptes, a glutaminase inhibitor (1 µm, bptes), or benzylserine (0.3 mm), an asct2 inhibitor, and the numbers of total surviving cells were quantified using microscopy (fig. 6d). uninfected cultures maintained for 21 days and then subjected to the blockers did not result in any cell death (fig. 6d, black and red lines). in contrast, the treatment with bptes (fig. 6d) plus benzylserine reduced the numbers of surviving cells (fig. 6d). indeed, results of treatment of surviving hiv infected cultures with benzylserine alone were similar to use of the combination of both inhibitors (fig. 6d).in conclusion , our results indicate that glutamate, glutamine, and α-kg are essential metabolites to preserve the survival of hiv reservoirs. also, activation of human macrophages with tnf-α plus ifn-γ did not result in similar metabolic changes (data not shown). thus, these metabolic changes are associated with the hiv infection and not due to general immune activation. together, these experiments showed that hiv infected cells acquired the ability to use glutamine as a major source of energy and to shift between different sources of energy.discussion our recently published study showed that a small population of human macrophages survive acute hiv infection and that these surviving infected cells become latently infected, as viral replication is not detected23. in the present study, we show that the surviving cells exhibit metabolic compromise and mitochondrial fusion, lose reliance on oxphos, and accumulate lipids. most of these changes could be mimicked by adding succinate or glutamine/glutamate to the cells, supporting a compromised tca cycle. despite these changes, no overall alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential or etc mitochondrial expression were detected. we also showed that while uninfected macrophages exclusively use glucose and fatty acids as major sources of energy, latently hiv infected macrophages use glutamine/glutamate as a significant source and gain the capability to shift from one metabolic source to another. furthermore, blocking the use of glutamate, glutamine, or α-kg results in the specific elimination of hiv surviving reservoirs. together, these data identify a unique metabolic signature of latently infected cells (not replicated by immune activation), which could be pharmacologically targeted to eliminate hiv reservoirs.our original study, using several cns cell types, including astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages, indicated that hiv infection, even in the absence of replication, deftly changes the entire metabolism of the cell. based on that study, the current study, and other reports, we hypothesize that hiv effects specific mitochondrial changes in order to 1. prevent apoptosis of the infected cell, allowing it to become a viral reservoir23,26,28; 2. reduce their energetic dependency and metabolism to abolish immune recognition; 3. use mitochondrial factors to amplify apoptosis and toxicity maintaining the survival of the few infected cells23,24,53,54; 4. use viral proteins to maintain survival and hiv associated inflammation55,56; 5. activate a “cancer-like program” to survive independently of efficient blood circulation57,58; 6. activate novel forms of viral reactivation8,24,59,60; 7. lastly, we propose that blocking these metabolic pathways could contribute to killing viral reservoirs. our previous work in human macrophages indicates that hiv blocks the formation of the apoptosome and that in surviving cells bim, a highly apoptotic protein, is recruited to the mitochondria without resulting in apoptosis23, suggesting that in hiv surviving cells, mitochondrial function is compromised. therefore, hiv uses the mitochondria not only to prevent apoptosis but also to maintain the survival of the hiv infected cells.there are numerous reports that hiv and art, including nrti (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), low nadir cd4, aging, and high body mass are directly associated with hiv associated mitochondrial dysfunction61,62,63,64. however, this damage has been attributed to non-specific effects of the virus and art. in contrast, we propose that the virus also controls mitochondrial function, because it provides specific advantages to the virus, including promoting the survival of latently infected macrophages, allowing them to become viral reservoirs.interestingly, the main attention on metabolism in the context of hiv has been focused on circulating cells and glucose transporter-1 (glut-1), which is upregulated in hiv infected individuals irrespective of art treatment and is associated with immune activation65,66. these results imply that active glycolysis and oxphos are the main sources of energy in circulating hiv infected cells40,66,67. however, we observed that infected cells acquired the ability to use glutamate/glutamine as a major energy source (fig. 6). interestingly, several reports focusing on glioblastoma have suggested that the use of glutamate/glutamine provided cancer cells with several advantages over using glucose and lipids, such as being independent of blood circulation and oxygen tension68,69,70. currently, only a few reports support a role of glutamine/glutamate as a major source of energy in hiv71,72,73. for instance, two recent independent reports indicated that in the periphery, cd4+ t cell counts were inversely correlated with high serum levels of glutamine and glucose, suggesting a role of these metabolites early on in infection and viral spread71,74. therefore, glutamine becomes an essential metabolite in early stages of hiv infection, but also is essential during the generation and survival of viral reservoirs.in macrophages, especially those from the brain, the dysregulation of glutamine/glutamate metabolism becomes more relevant because glutamate/glutamine levels are highly regulated by glial cells75,76,77. we have demonstrated that glial cells are dysregulated by hiv infection, even in the absence of viral replication, by amplifying neurotransmitter dysfunction via gap junction channels27,29,54,56,78. furthermore, the use of this alternative fuel could provide an unlimited source of energy for hiv infected cells to survive within the brain. several different neuroimaging experiments support this novel hypothesis: first, the numbers of infected cells are low1,79,80; second, changes in brain volume in the current art era do not correlate with viral replication81,82,83,84; third, currently few neuronal markers of acute damage are found by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mrs53,85,86,87; fourth, the main compromised metabolites are related to glutamine as found in our studies85,88,89,90,91,92. glutamine can also be potentially used to produce nucleotides for dna replication or signaling, including atp and gmp93, both of which are essential for cell to cell signaling and viral replication. therefore, local glutamate/glutamine dysregulation could be used as a biomarker of hiv infection, be exploited in potential treatments, and could also explain the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to several types of cancer that may also use glutamine/glutamate as a major source of energy to survive22,94. our experiments blocking glutaminase and asct2 indicate a specific killing of surviving hiv infected macrophages, but not uninfected macrophages. asct2 is the major transporter responsible for glutamine uptake into the mitochondria and has been targeted in several cancers resulting in decreased growth and proliferation95,96. thus, targeting these pathways is an attractive potential target to eliminate viral reservoirs.various potential biomarkers of hiv cns disease have been proposed by several groups, including neopterin, neurofilament-light (nfl), bc11b, beta-2-microglobulin, several markers of inflammation (scd163, ccl2, tnf-α, il-6, scd14, and cxcl10), and interferon-alpha97,98,99,100. however, all these biomarkers are associated with already occurring tissue damage and do not predict future damage. only recently nih sponsored groups such as charter, nntc, neuroimaging consortium, and proteomic determinations done by several laboratories have indicated that local alterations in metabolites could predict disease onset. some of these metabolites and mitochondrial markers are citrate, creatinine, glutamine, glucose, inositol, glutamic acid, and csf mtdna99,101,102,103,104. thus, hiv infection, even in the absence of replication, has profound effects on the metabolism of infected cells, which may help to perpetuate the virus or promote the survival of infected cells.in agreement with our data, several viruses, such as hcv, kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (kshv), adenovirus, and dengue virus, use glutamine-derived carbons as a significant source of energy during their pathogenesis105,106,107,108,109. as described above, the best-described disease where glutamine is used for energy is cancer, especially neuroblastoma110,111,112. studies of glioblastoma demonstrate that glutamine is not only a substrate for several enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism but is also essential for the synthesis of nucleotides, other amino acids, and glucosamine113,114, all of which are essential for hiv infection, the formation of viral reservoirs, and reactivation. several types of cancers, including glioblastoma, exhibit a high dependency on glutamine, also called “glutamine addiction,” and inhibition of these pathways has been shown to reduce tumor growth and induce cancer cell death115,116,117,118. we suggest that this avenue should also be explored as an alternative treatment to reduce or eliminate viral reservoirs."
Impact of HIV-ART on the restoration of Th17 and Treg cells in blood and female genital mucosa,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38547-1,Research,13 February 2019,yes,"the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment (art) on the proportion and functions of th17 and treg cells in peripheral blood and female genital tract (fgt) respectively. to this aim, samples from 41 hiv-neg, 33 hiv+ art-naïve and 32 hiv+ art+ subjects were obtained. in peripheral blood, altered th17 and th17/treg proportions were normalized in hiv+ art+, but certain abnormal treg and activated t-cell proportions were still observed. in fgt, abnormal patterns of secretion for th17-related cytokines were observed in cervical mononuclear cells (cmcs) from hiv+ women, even in those from hiv+ art+, compared to the hiv-neg group. moreover, these altered patterns of secretion were associated with diminished levels of cxcl5 and cxcl1 chemokines and with an immunoregulatory skew in the ccl17/ccl20 ratio in ectocervix samples of these women. finally, art did not restore proportions of th17-precursor cells with gut-homing potential in pbmcs, and positive correlations between these cells and the levels of il-17f and il-21 production by cmcs may suggest that a better homing of these cells to the intestine could also imply a better restoration of these cells in the female genital tract. these results indicate that antiretroviral treatment did not restore th17-related immune functions completely at the female mucosal level.
introduction treg and th17 cell subsets are characterized by the expression of specific transcriptional factors, chemokine receptors and by the secretion of specific cytokine and chemokines. these subsets are important for the differentiation, expansion, homing capacity, and recruitment of several different immune cell populations to the site of infection1. notably, both t cell subsets play crucial roles in mucosal tissues by maintaining the mucosal barrier integrity (th17 cells) and preventing inflammation (treg cells)2. th17 cells a cd4+ t-cell subset of a lineage different from th1 and th2, is characterized by the secretion of a distinctive pattern of cytokines: il-17a, il-17f, il-21 and il-22, involved in the in vivo function of these cells3,4. th17 cells play an essential role in mucosal immunity, maintaining thus the mucosal barriers5,6, and working in the response to extracellular bacteria and fungi by promoting neutrophil recruitment7,8, or by inducing epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides such as β-defensin 2 (hbd-2) and hbd-39, and mucins such as muc5ac and muc5b10. regulatory t cells constitute a specialized subpopulation of cd4+ t lymphocytes that are critical to the immune balance and to the effective functioning of the immune system, both in normal and diseased states. treg cells mediate their suppressive function by controlling the activation and expansion of immune cells. they control inflammation by producing immunosuppressive cytokines11 and inducing cytokine deprivation apoptosis of effector cd4+ t cells12. the functional effect of tregs on hiv immune pathogenesis remains poorly understood. thus, while some findings have revealed a beneficial effect through the suppression of chronic immune activation, others observe a detrimental role since the inhibition of specific hiv immune response through suppressive potential can promote viral persistence in the host13,14. different works have demonstrated that siv and hiv infections lead to selective depletion of th17 cells in both blood and gastrointestinal lymphoid tissues that can predict disease progression15,16. indeed, many studies highlight the importance of the th17/treg ratio in disease progression during hiv-1 and siv infections1,17. our previous study described the relevance of th17 cells during primary hiv infection (phi)18, finding an association between a better clinical status with higher th17 and lower treg levels. most important, for the first time we demonstrated that during phi, higher th17 levels directly correlated with more potent hiv antiviral t-cell responses associated with protection.the events that occur at the genital mucosa level play a prominent role in hiv immunopathogenesis, as it is the place where the initial viral replication occurs after vaginal transmission of hiv in women and siv in macaques19,20. in relation to the relevance of th17 cells in the mucosal genital tract during hiv infection, a pronounced depletion of this t-cell subset was described in the cervical mucosa from hiv+ female sex workers compared to hiv-neg women21. another study from the same authors showed that a reduction in the frequency of th17 cells in the cervical mucosa takes place during early hiv infection22, suggesting a similar scenario to that found in the intestine. even more, in the siv model stieh et al., corroborated these previous findings identifying th17 lineage ccr6+ cd4+ t-cells as primary targets for siv during vaginal transmission23. one of the answers to the faster decrease in this t-cell subset, could be related to a higher susceptibility of th17 cells to hiv-infection24,25, in line with their earlier disappearance from the gut and cervix of hiv-infected patients.due to the relevance of th17 cells and th17/treg balance during hiv infection, the analysis of the restoration of these parameters upon antiretroviral treatment (art) is necessary. thus, several studies have analyzed the effects of art on the restoration of th17 cells focused on the analysis of pbmcs and the intestinal mucosa. results indicated that in many cases, although viral load was suppressed, th17 responses were not restored in all the patients26,27. on the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that the intestinal mucosal th17 cell function is altered during hiv infection and although art could normalize th17 cell numbers, functionality restoration was delayed28. even when art is initiated at early stages post-infection, such as fiebig iii stage, th17 cell polyfunctionality could not be restored29. although hiv infection causes depletion of cd4+ tregs leading to their lower absolute cell numbers in blood and gut mucosa30, foxp3+ tregs are observed in increased proportions in relation to th17 cells in gut mucosa and oral mucosa during siv/hiv infection17,31,32. in this sense, it has been proposed that pro-inflammatory milieu in art-treated patients with immune activation significantly contributes to an enhanced loss of th17 cells and an increased in the frequency of dysregulated tregs in the mucosa, which in turn may exacerbate immune dysfunction in hiv-infected patients2.it is known that during pregnancy, the maternal immune system needs to adapt to tolerate a semi-allogeneic fetus, both treg cells and uterine nk cells appear to participate in this process33. however, there is little information about whether treg cells are more abundant in the reproductive tract of hiv-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls, or whether treg cells modulate t cell responses and/or immune activation in reproductive tissues34. in this regard, it has been described that hiv-1 highly-exposed seronegative (hesn) female commercial sex workers (csws) had higher frequencies of endocervical regulatory cd4+ t-cells when compared to both hiv-1-infected csws and hiv-1-uninfected non-csws35.on the other hand, although it has been described that th17 cells are highly enriched in the mucosal female reproductive tract36 and that after hiv infection a significant depletion of this t-cell subset in this mucosal compartment occurs21,22, until now there is no study in which they have evaluated in detail th17-cell functionality or reestablishment in fgt after art initiation. the only data available comes from the work by masson et al.37, in which the authors described that cervical th17 cell frequencies were similar in hiv-uninfected and hiv-infected women (art+ or art naïve).thus, taking into account the disturbance that occurs with th17 and treg cells during hiv infection and the important role played by both t-cell subsets have in the mucosal immunity, the aim of this study was to evaluate the recovery in terms of quantity and functionality of the before-mentioned subpopulations in periphery and in the female genital tract after the administration of antiretroviral treatment.resultsart restores th17 proportions and th17/treg ratios in blood, but abnormal t-cell activation and treg levels were still maintainedin our previous report18, th17 and treg subsets and their correlation with hiv-specific t-cell responses and clinical parameters were analyzed during (acute/early) primary hiv infection (phi). we found that, percentages of th17 and treg subsets were severely altered in art-naïve chronically-infected individuals, whereas an imbalance of th17/treg ratio was observed in all hiv+ groups compared to healthy donors (hds), including phi at baseline and elite controllers.thus, taking into account these important effects that occurred during hiv infection, our first inquiry was to evaluate the ability of art to normalize these parameters. as the majority of hiv+ individuals diagnosed in argentina initiate art during the chronic phase of infection, we considered important to analyze treatment effectiveness in these patients. therefore, the hiv+ subjects on treatment recruited in the study had all initiated art during the chronic phase of infection with a median (iqr) of 6.5 (3.00–15.50) years on treatment and a median of 3.33 (1.48–5.25) years with documented suppressed vl (table 1). additional data specifying the drugs applied in the arts is described in (supplementary table s1). figure 1(a–c) shows that in the group of chronically-infected patients still in absence of treatment (hiv+ art−), percentages of th17, treg cells, and th17/treg ratios were significantly altered compared to the values observed in the hiv-neg group. thus, proportions of th17 and treg cells found in hiv+ art− were approximately 1/3 fold less and 1,5 fold higher respectively, in relation to the levels found in the hiv-neg group. in consequence, the alterations in both t-cell subpopulations (lower th17 and higher treg proportions) produced significantly lower th17/treg ratios in hiv+ art− [0.03 (0.0125–0.085) vs. hiv-neg 0.52 (0.2050–1.085); p < 0.0001)]. on the other hand, in the hiv+ art+ group we found that the median (iqr) of %th17 and th17/treg ratio values (fig. 1a,c) were restored [th17: 0.34 (0.17–0.58), th17/treg ratio: 0.39 (0.1675–1.575)]. significant differences were found compared to the group without treatment (p < 0.0001); while in the hiv-neg group, differences were not significant (th17: p = 0.1160 and th17/treg ratio: p = 0.9367).table 1 clinical characteristics of groups of

(b) the p values obtained are depicted as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001.full size imageanalysis of the secretion pattern of th17 and treg cytokines indicated that hiv infection significantly altered functionality of genital mucosal cmcs for th17-related cytokinesa more in-depth analysis was conducted aimed at evaluating whether the infection with hiv could produce an alteration in the pattern of th17 and treg-related cytokines secreted by cmcs. this analysis was done as an indirect measure of the functionality of these cells at the mucosal genital tract level. to this, we constructed the th17 and treg-cytokine global patterns detected in the supernatants of the cmcs samples of the different groups and statistical comparisons were performed by chi square test (fig. 4a,b). thus, for the hiv-neg group when il-17a, il-17f and il-21 were measured for the global th17 pattern (fig. 4a left panel), this consisted in a proportion of 40%, 35%, 20% and 5% of samples with 3 cytokines, 2 cytokines, 1cytokine or none-cytokine respectively. for the hiv+ art− group this global pattern of secretion was severely modified, as in this case, the proportion of samples with 3 cytokines, 2 cytokines, 1 cytokine or none-cytokine were: 0%, 18.18%, 36.36% and 45.45% respectively (in comparison with the hiv-neg pattern p < 0.01). a similar scenario was observed when four th17-related cytokines (il-17a, il-17f, il-21 and il-22) were determined for the construction of the global th17 pattern (fig. 4a right panel), (hiv-neg vs hiv+ art−: p < 0.05). in the hiv+ art+ group, it can be appreciated that both global th17-cytokine patterns (fig. 4a) tended to be restored as significant differences in comparison with the hiv-neg group were not found. in contrast with the scenario observed in the th17 patterns, no significant differences were found between the different groups in the treg-cytokine global patterns (fig. 4b), thus suggesting that during hiv infection even in the absence of treatment, functionality of cmcs in relation to il-10 and tgf-β1 was not significantly altered.figure 4secretion patterns of th17 and treg-cks indicated that hiv infection altered functionality of genital mucosal cmcs for th17-related cytokines. (a) global th17-related ck patterns detected in the cmcs samples from the different groups. il-17a, il-17f, il-21 and il-22 production was evaluated in the supernatants by cba, il-22 production was determined depending on sample availability. pie-charts represent the percentage of samples in each group with no ck, 1ck, 2cks, 3cks, or 4 cks detected for each of the th17 global patterns represented. (b) global treg-related ck patterns detected in the cmcs samples from the different groups. il-10 production was evaluated in the supernatants by cba and tgf-β1 was evaluated by elisa depending on sample availability. pie-charts represent the percentage of samples in each group with no ck, 1 ck or 2 cks detected for the treg-related cytokine global pattern. significant differences between global patterns are indicated. different colors represent different number of cytokines produced, as indicated in the figure. below each pie it is indicated the number of subjects in which the global pattern was evaluated. (c) tables show the percentages of samples in each of the patient groups with the indicated number of cytokines present in the cmcs samples. left panel: th17-related cks, right panel treg-related cks. the p values shown are in comparison to the hiv-neg group and are depicted as *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.full size imagefigure 4c depicts the percentages of cmcs samples with no-cytokine, 1 cytokine, 2 cytokine, 3 cytokine or 4 cytokine for th17 (left panel) or no-cytokine, 1 cytokine or 2 cytokine for treg (right panel) related cytokines of the three groups. mirroring the scenario observed after the analysis of the global cytokine patterns described above, significant differences were only observed for the th17-cytokines. thus, whereas only 5% of the hiv-neg samples showed no cytokines (for il-17a, il-17f and il-21) (fig. 4c left panel), this proportion was incremented in 45.45% (p = 0.01) in hiv+ art− samples and 33.33% (p = 0.022) in hiv+ art+. on the other hand, we found 40% of samples with 3 cytokines in hiv-neg, in contrast with 0% of the hiv+ art− samples with 3 cytokines (p = 0.021). after treatment (hiv+ art+), this proportion was incremented in 26.67%, (p = 0.327) although not reaching the proportions observed in hiv-neg. when four th17-related cytokines were analyzed (il-17a, il-17f, il-21 and il-22) (fig. 4c right panel), the proportion of samples with 4 cytokines detected in hiv-neg was 62.5% in contrast to 0% (p = 0.0326) in hiv+ art− and 16.67% (p = 0.0281) in hiv+ art+.conversely, the analysis of the percentage of samples with no-cytokine, 1cytokine or 2cytokines for treg-related cytokines (fig. 4c right panel), showed none significant differences between groups for any case.these last analyses indicated that in the absence of the art global pattern of secretion of th17-related cytokines of cmcs was severely altered, after treatment this global pattern tended to be restored. however, significant differences were still found in the proportion of samples with no and four cytokines compared to the hiv-neg group.cmcs functionality (related to th17 and treg-cytokines) was associated with local mucosal genital chemokine levelsthe results described above suggest that hiv infection severely affected the functionality of the female mucosal genital tract cells (cmcs), and the administration of antiretroviral treatment even after a relatively long period of time (see table 1) was not able to restore the functional characteristics as observed in the absence of hiv infection (hiv-neg group). on the other hand, different studies have shown that hiv infection perturbed the local genital mucosal environment generating alterations in the baseline chemokine/cytokine levels43,44. thus, our next aim was focused on the study of possible alterations in the chemokine levels of a total of 13 human pro-inflammatory chemokines in ectocervix samples from the different groups. then, we analyzed whether cmcs functionality (in terms of th17 and treg-related cytokines) could have any relationship with the chemokines that were altered. supplementary table s3 describes the quantities of the specified chemokines detected in the supernatants of the ectocervix swabs from the different groups. of note, when the total protein content was evaluated in the ectocervix samples, no significant differences were detected between the groups (data not shown), suggesting that a homogeneous quantity of material was obtained from all samples independently of the subject group.of the thirteen molecules evaluated, significant differences were detected in the hiv+ groups compared to hiv-neg for three of them (cxcl5, cxcl1 and ccl17). remarkably, no significant differences were observed between the hiv+ groups (art− vs. art+), for none of the chemokines evaluated (table s3). figure 5 a depicts the levels of cxcl5, cxcl1 and ccl17 chemokines detected in the ectocervix samples of the different groups. the cxc chemokines: cxcl5 or ena-78, and cxcl1 or gro-α (fig. 5 column a rows i and ii) both use the same cellular receptor (cxcr2) and are capable of trafficking neutrophils as the main function. notably, both chemokines were found in lower levels in both hiv+ groups in relation to the group of hiv-negative women. thus, whereas median cxcl5 levels found in hiv-neg were 51.34 pg/ml (18.76–100.1), the levels detected in hiv+ art− and hiv+ art+ were 12.89 pg/ml (5.975–47.96) (p < 0.05) and 9.6 pg/ml (4.96–28.31) (p < 0.01). and for cxcl1, in hiv-neg, the median values were 149 pg/ml (98.87–226.9), vs. 69.87 pg/ml (34.66–127.1) in hiv+ art+ patients (p < 0.01) and 60.28 pg/ml in hiv+ art− (24.52–501.2) (p > 0.05, probably not significant due to a high variability of data). another chemokine which showed significant differences between groups was ccl17 also known as tarc (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine), involved in the homing of treg cells. as observed in fig. 5a,iv, the median ccl17 values found in hiv-neg were 3.35 pg/ml (2.49–4.06), while the values detected in samples from hiv+ art− and hiv+ art+ were significantly higher: 4.78 (3–6.43) (p < 0.05) and 4.6 (3.35–5.33) (p < 0.01) respectively.figure 5functionality of cmcs (related to th17 and treg-cks) was associated with local mucosal genital chemokine levels. chemokine levels were quantified by cba (pg/ml) in ectocervix samples from the different groups as described in methodology (column a): row i: cxcl5 (ena-78), (ii) cxcl1 (gro-α), (iii) ccl17/ccl20 ratio (tarc/mip-3α ratio) and (iv) ccl17

correlations. symbols represent individual subjects: hiv-neg (○), hiv+ art− (●), hiv+ art+ (◉).full size imageas already mentioned, higher values of the ccl17/ccl20 ratio (treg chemokine/th17 chemokine) were found in the hiv+ groups (fig. 5a,iii), and in this case when the hiv+ art+ was subdivided, higher ratio levels were detected in the subgroup of patients with ≤1 th17 cytokine (median 1.5 (0.94–1.63; p < 0.05 vs. hiv−), while significant differences vs. hiv-neg were lost when compared to the subgroup with ≥3th17cytokines (fig. 5b,iii). similar results were found for the ccl17/ccl20 ratio when the hiv+ art+ group was subdivided accordingly if they had: ≥3th17cytokines + 2treg cytokines vs. ≤1 th17-cytokine + ≤1 treg-cytokine (fig. 5c,iii). thus, significant differences compared to the hiv-neg group were only maintained with the group: ≤1 th17-cytokine + ≤1 treg- cytokine. figure 5d,iii shows that ccl17/ccl20 ratios in hiv+ art+ patients indirectly correlated with il-17a levels in supernatants from cmcs (r = −0.6798 p = 0.0019 (p = 0.011 after fdr adjustment)).ccl17 was elevated in both hiv+ groups (fig. 5a,iv). as this chemokine is involved in treg chemotaxis, in this specific case the hiv+ art+ group was subdivided accordingly to if there were two treg-cytokines vs. one or less treg-cytokines (2 treg-cytokines vs. ≤1 treg-cytokine) (fig. 5b,iv). after this subdivision, significant higher levels of this chemokine were only detected in the group with 2 treg-cytokines (fig. 5b,iv), and when the analysis was performed according to the other criterion (≥ 3th17cytokines + 2treg cytokines vs. ≤1 th17-cytokine + ≤1 treg-cytokine), higher values were still found in the group with 2 treg cytokines (≥3th17-cytokines + 2treg-cytokines) (fig. 5c,iv). for this chemokine, a significant positive correlation with il-10 levels was observed in supernatants from cmcs (fig. 5d,iv) (r = 0.56; p = 0.0196).proportions of cd161+ cd4+ t-cells in peripheral blood were significantly reduced in both hiv+ groups (art− and art+) compared to hiv-neg, and were directly correlated with the genital cmcs production of il-17f and il-21it has been described that th17 cells arise from a population of cd161+ cd4+ t-cells and that this precursor population has gut-homing potential46,47. on the other hand, it has also been reported that hiv-infected individuals showed a reduced number of peripheral cd161+ cd4+ cells, which may limit th17 restoration in mucosal compartments16. taking into account this background information, we aimed to quantify this t-cell population in peripheral blood of the three study groups in order to evaluate the ability of the treatment to restore this th17 precursor cells with mucosal gut-homing potential.in fig. 6a it can be seen that significantly minor proportions of cd161+ cd4+ t cells were detected in hiv+ subjects compared to hiv-neg, as the median percentages found in hiv-neg were 12.37 (9.56–20.37) compared to the median percentages values of 6.37 (3.3–8.41) (p < 0.001) and 7.56 (5.91–11.10) (p < 0.01) detected in hiv+ art− and hiv+ art+ groups respectively. it is noteworthy, that in contrast with what it was observed when percentages of th17 cells were evaluated by intracellular il-17a staining (fig. 1a), it seems that proportions of cd161+ cd4+ t-cells were not restored after art.finally, a positive correlation between the proportions of cd4+ cd161+ t-cells in pbmcs and the levels of il-17f production by cmcs from endocervical samples (fig. 6b) was found. this positive correlation was observed in the hiv+ art+ group (fig. 6b left panel) (r = 0.741, p = 0.018; p = 0.07 after fdr adjustment) and in the hiv-neg group, even with stronger significance (r = 0.72, p = 0.0037; p = 0.014 after fdr adjustment) (fig. 6b right panel). even more, a similar positive correlation was also found between % cd4+ cd161+ t-cells and log il-21 production from cmcs in both groups (hiv−: r = 0.826, p = 0.016; p = 0.o3 after fdr adjustment, hiv+ art+: r = 0.786, p = 0.048; p = 0.09 after fdr adjustment) (see supplementary fig. s4). these last results indicate that the presence of higher proportions of this th17 precursor cell-population with mucosal homing potential is directly associated with higher production levels of the th17-related cytokines such as il-17f and il-21 by cmcs.discussion the relevance of both th17 and treg cells in hiv immunopathogenesis in addition to the crucial roles played by these t-cell populations in maintaining the mucosal barrier integrity and preventing inflammation, suggests a need for an in-depth analysis of restoration in hiv+ individuals on art.in this study, proportions of th17 and treg cell subsets and th17/treg values were analyzed in pbmcs from a group of patients with a median of 6.50 years on treatment, and a median of 3.33 years with corroborated vl suppression. percentages of th17 and th17/treg values were found to be restored, showing no significant differences compared to the hiv-neg group. however, proportions of treg cells in the hiv+ art+ group were still higher in relation to the proportions detected in hiv-neg. in a previous report performed with pbmcs48 the authors found that after a median of three years of treatment, the proportions of th17 cells were restored, and the %treg cells diminished to values comparable to those found in the hiv− group. however, in that study contrary to what has been reported in many reports, the th17/treg ratios found in hiv+ naïve subjects did not show significant differences with respect to hiv-neg. whereas in another study, after 12- months treatment, although th17/treg values were reestablished, percentages of both th17 and treg did not even reach those values found in healthy donors49. when t-cell activation levels were evaluated in peripheral blood in the different study groups, the elevated t-cell activation proportions observed in naïve hiv+ subjects, were significantly reduced in hiv+ art+ patients. however, the levels of both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell activated cells detected in this latter group were somehow even elevated compared to hiv-neg individuals, in line with data from previous reports29,38,39,40,41. interestingly, we found that when the proportion of cd39-treg cells was analyzed in the hiv+ art+ group, an inverse correlation between the percentage of functionally active treg cells (foxp3+ cd39+) and levels of cd8+ t-cell activation was detected. cd39 was described as a surface marker of functionally active human treg cells42, and although there is still controversy regarding the role of cd39 in hiv infection, it can be hypothesized that cd39+ tregs are likely critical for the down modulation of t-cell immune activation, reducing niches for hiv replication50,51.undoubtedly, an important issue addressed in this work was the analysis of the effects of art on the functionality of mucosal cells from the female reproductive tract by studying the production of th17-related and treg-related cytokines by cmcs after pma plus ionomycin activation. qualitative and quantitative analyses of the cmcs secreted cytokines revealed that in the absence of treatment (hiv+ art−), significant reductions were found in the proportion of samples with positive responses for the th17-related cytokines and also in the levels of the four th17-cytokines and of il-10, compared to values found in hiv-neg women. after treatment (hiv+ art+), although higher quantities of cytokines were detected generally, a tendency to find lower levels of cytokines vs. the hiv-neg group was still observed.functionality of t-cells can be measured as the capacity to secrete multiple cytokines in order to exert their effector activities in an optimal manner. in this study, we generated the th17 and treg cytokine global patterns of secretion detected after pma plus ionomycin stimulation of cmcs to evaluate the functionality of these cells in relation to the secretion of these cytokines (fig. 3). results showed that global patterns of secretion for th17-related cytokines were severely affected in cmcs from both groups of hiv-infected women, whereas the pattern of secretion of treg cytokines was not significantly altered. previous reports have described impaired functionality of intestinal mucosal th17 cells during hiv infection. thus, for instance kim et al.28, showed that polyfunctionality of intestinal th17 cells was severely altered post-infection and that these functional alterations occur even earlier than the reductions in th17 numbers, being less readily reversed after art initiation. in another elegant study performed with 42 individuals with acute hiv infection (ahi) (fiebig (f) stage i–v), the authors showed that art initiated at fi/ii stages prevented loss of th17 cell numbers and functionality. however, late treatment initiation (at fiii stage) restored th17 cell numbers but not their polyfunctionality29. nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no reports focused on the effects of art on the functionality of female mucosal genital cells in relation to th17 or treg-related cytokines. interestingly, in a recent study based on the characterization of the presence of cd161+ t cells in the female reproductive tract of hiv-neg women52, the authors demonstrated that the cervical compartment was significantly more polyfunctional than the blood compartment with both cd161+ and cd161− th cell fractions harboring elevated proportion of cells secreting three cytokines (il-17, il-22 and ifn-g) simultaneously. however, the functionality of cervical cd161+ th17 cells in hiv+ women was not analyzed.analysis of thirteen chemokines in ectocervix samples showed that two of them (cxcl5 and cxcl1) characterized to be neutrophil-chemoattractants, were detected in significant lower levels in both hiv+ groups compared to the levels found in hiv-neg women. to inquire if the alteration in the cmcs functionality, principally for th17-related cytokines, could be associated with the altered chemokine levels observed, the hiv+ art+ group was subdivided into two, when there were “at least three” or “one or less” th17 cytokines in cmcs samples. after this subdivision, only significant lower levels of the chemokines were detected in the sub-group in which one or less th17 cytokines were detected, whereas the subgroup with at least three th17 cytokines showed no significant differences compared to the chemokine levels found in hiv-neg ectocervix samples. of note, these differences were maintained or even enlarged when secretion of treg-related cytokines was also considered for the subdivision of the hiv+ art+ group (≥3th17cytokines + 2treg cytokines vs ≤1 th17 cytokine + ≤1 treg cytokine). these results may indicate that cmcs functionality in relation to the capacity to secrete multiple th17 cytokines is associated with the quantities of cxcl5 and cxcl1 chemokines present in ectocervix. in agreement with the fact that one of the main functions of th17 cells is the recruitment of neutrophils, thus il-17a and il-17f can induce the production of neutrophil, chemoattractants (cxcl1, cxcl2 and cxcl5) in epithelial cells8,53.the relationship found in our study between the cmcs dis-functionality, with respect to the th17-related cytokines, and effector functions exerted by these cytokines such as the induction of neutrophil recruiting chemokines, it is possible to have relevant consequences in the context of the local genital immunity. thus, the lower levels of cxcl5 and cxcl1 found in hiv+ ectocervix samples could imply an impaired immunity against potential pathogens of the mucosal genital tract. in fact, relevance of il-17 mediated immunity in the female genital tract has been analyzed in different studies against different pathogens. accordingly, in one of them, a critical role for th17 and il-17 against neiserria gonorrheae mice genital infection mediated by influx of neutrophils was demonstrated54, and another study showed that il-17 contributes to the development of th1 immunity and neutrophil recruitment during chlamidia muridarum genital tract infection55. even more, a recent study showed the importance of il-17 in antiviral immunity in the female genital tract against hsv-256.we also detected higher levels of ccl17 (treg chemoatractant57,58) and higher values in the ratio of ccl17/ccl20 (th17 chemokine) in both hiv+ groups, which correlated directly with il-10 levels and indirectly with il-17a, respectively (fig. 5iii and iv). these data could suggest a trend to an immunoregulatory skew in the chemokine pattern in the genital samples of hiv+ women. indeed, these results are in line with the altered genital mucosal th17 functionality and minor alterations observed in treg cytokines (il-10 and tfg-β) found in hiv+ art naïve and treated individuals. similar results were found in previous findings based on intestinal mucosal cells, where one of them showed a reduction in ccl20 production by intestinal cells from hiv+ treated individuals, with an increase in the frequency of gut foxp3 treg cells associated with a shift from il-17 to il-10 and tfg-β59. in another study, it was shown that the mucosal th17 function in the intestine is altered during hiv infection, and the authors described an immunoregulatory skewing of th17 function characterized by an increase in the il-10/tnf-α ratio28.it should be noted that despite the novelty of our findings, one of the constraints of the present study was that although th17 and treg-related cytokines secreted by cmcs were evaluated after pma/ionomycin stimulation (inducing principally t-cell activation) nk cells and other innate lymphoid cells can secrete il-17a and il-22, as well as macrophages can produce il-10. on the other hand, another limitation is that although samples from patients with evidence of sexually transmitted infections (stis) (associated with visible discharge, ulceration or macroscopic cervical changes) were excluded from the study, frequencies of actual lab-confirmed stis or bv may have been underestimated, which may influence th17 responses and cytokines.cd161+ cd4+ t-cells, precursors of the th17-cell population with gut-homing potential46,47, were found in significant minor proportions in pbmcs in both hiv+ groups compared to healthy donors, and to remark the levels of these cells in hiv+ art+ did not result significantly higher than those observed in the group of hiv+ art naïve individuals. results from previous reports on cd161+ cd4+ t-cells in pbmcs of hiv+ subjects described a significant reduction in these cells of hiv-infected persons16, whereas another study did not find any differences in blood cd4+ cd161+ t-cells between hiv-negative and hiv-positive female sex-workers52. the positive correlations that we found between the proportions of cd4+ cd161+ t-cells in pbmcs and the levels of il-17f and il-21 production by cmcs from endocervical samples, may suggest an indication of cd4+ cd161+ t-cell homing to the mucosal genital tract, as it has recently been described for the first time that cd161+ cd4+ t cells are enriched in this mucosal site52. on the other hand, as this t-cell population has been identified with gut-homing characteristics, it may also suggest that a better homing of cd4+ cd161+ t-cells to the intestine also implies an improved restoration of these cells in the female genital tract (higher production of il-21 and il-17f cytokines from cmcs).in brief, results from this study indicated that after art, the altered th17 and th17/treg proportions were normalized in peripheral blood. however, in fgt, abnormal patterns of secretion of th17-related cytokines were observed in cmcs from hiv+ women even in those of the hiv+ art+ group. this altered th17-cytokines pattern, was associated with diminished levels of the cxcl5 and cxcl1 neutrophil chemokines and with an immunoregulatory skew in the ratio of ccl17/ccl20 in the ectocervix samples of these women. art could not restore proportions of cd4+ cd161+ t-cells in pbmcs, and positive correlations between these cells and the levels of il-17f and il-21 production by cmcs may suggest that a better homing of cd4+ cd161+ t-cells to the intestine would also imply a better restoration of these cells in the female genital tract. the main findings of this study suggested that hiv infection has an impact on th17-related functions at the female mucosal tract and art initiated during chronic stage was not completely effective in restoring it.materials and methodsdescription of individuals included in the studya total of 106 individuals participated in this study: 41 healthy hiv seronegative donors (hiv-negative) and 65 hiv infected patients of whom 33 were chronically infected patients naïve of antiretroviral therapy (hiv+ art−) and 32 were chronically infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (hiv+ art+). the main clinical characteristics of the subjects are described in table 1. a portion (n = 20) of the total hiv-neg (n = 41) subjects included in this study were voluntary blood donors from sanatorio dr. julio mendez blood bank (buenos aires, argentina; all of them were individuals older than 18 years of age that completed and passed a survey on blood donation and were screened for serological markers before being accepted as donors). the rest of them were recruited at the hospital general de agudos “dr. juan a. fernández” [buenos aires, argentina; all blood samples were confirmed to be negative for hiv-1 and hiv-2 by vikia hiv1/2 quick test (biomérieux sa) followed by genscreen ultra hiv ag-ab elisa (bio-rad) according to the current diagnostic algorithm]. chronic hiv+ art− patients were defined as individuals with documented hiv-1 infection for more than 3 years or with cd4 counts less than 350, and with detectable plasma viral loads (vl; between 500 and 500.000 hiv-1 rna copies/ml plasma), and art naïve at the time of sample collection. chronic hiv+ art+ includes subjects with established hiv-1 infection for more than 3 years, with a median (iqr) of 14 (6.75–19) years from the first positive serology and were on art. the main characteristics of the subjects of the different groups are described in table 1. this study was reviewed and approved by two institutional review boards: comité de ética en investigación hospital fernández (ceihf) hospital general de agudos juan a. fernández (buenos aires, argentina; protocolo codei 201115, 22/09/2014) and comité de etica fundación huésped (10/2013) (buenos aires, argentina). all participants provided written informed consent and accepted to participate in this study. the methods applied were carried out in line with the approved guidelines.collection and processing of blood samplesblood samples were collected at enrollment on tubes with edta and centrifuged to separate plasma. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated by ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation (amersham, sweden) and cryopreserved by standard procedures. plasma vl (branched-dna, versant hiv-1 rna 3.0 assay; siemens healthcare, uk) and cd4/cd8 counts (flow cytometry double platform, bd facscanto; bd biosciences) were routinely determined in samples from all hiv infected patients and in samples from the hiv-neg donors enrolled at the hospital general de agudos “dr. juan a. fernández”. subsequent functional assays were performed according to sample availability, using only thawed cells with >95% viability after overnight rest in complete rpmi medium [rpmi-1640 (sigma-aldrich, usa) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; gibco, usa), 2 mm l-glutamine (sigma-aldrich, usa), 100 u/ml penicillin (sigma-aldrich, usa), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (sigma-aldrich, usa), and 10 mm hepes (gibco, usa)].collection and processing of female genital mucosal samplespaired blood and genital mucosal samples were obtained from the women recruited in the study. those female mucosal samples of women who were menstruating at sampling time, were peri or post-menopausal, or had undergone a hysterectomy were excluded from the study. samples from patients with evidence of sexually transmitted infections (stis) (associated with visible discharge, ulceration or macroscopic cervical changes) were also excluded. considering the above mentioned variables to select the mucosal samples, the number of women that were screened to get the final number enrolled in each group were: 50 women for the hiv+ art+ group (to get the 31 selected), approximately 27 women for the hiv− group (to get the 21 selected) and 19 women for the hiv+ art− group (to get the 12 selected).female mucosal samples involved the collection of two types of samples in the following order: (i) under speculum examination, after cleaning the zone of excessive mucus, a cotton genital swab was introduced into the fornix, rotated 360° and immediately disposed in a 15 ml tube containing 3 ml of cold sterile pbs supplemented with 30 ul of a 100x cocktail of protease inhibitors (cat num: 78410 thermo-fischer) (ectocervical swab); (ii) immediately afterwards, two cytobrushes (digene corp., usa) were sequentially introduced into the endocervical os, up to the transformation zone, rotated once 360° and immediately disposed in a single 15 ml tube containing 3 ml of cold rpmi medium [rpmi-1640 (sigma-aldrich, usa) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (sigma-aldrich, usa), 100 u/ml penicillin (sigma-aldrich, usa), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (sigma-aldrich, usa), 10 mm hepes (gibco, usa) and 1% fungizone (invitrogen)]. all samples were transported on ice and processed within 4 hours of collection. samples with visible blood contamination and/or excessive mucus were discarded.to obtain ectocervix soluble mediators, swab samples were processed as described previously60. the tube was vortexed for approximately 30 seconds and then the swab was compressed against the side of the tube to maximize elution of genital tract secretions. afterwards, the swab was discarded and the tube was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm to remove cell debris. the supernatant was stored at −80 °c until use. cervical mononuclear cells (cmcs) from the cytobrushes were obtained as previously described21,61, by manual shaking and extensive washing with a pasteur pipette and filtered through a 100-mm filter (becton dickinson [bd]). after centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 rpm cell pellets were resuspended in complete rpmi medium supplemented with fungizone (1%). viable cmcs were assessed by tripan blue dye and cells were immediately used. in preliminary experiments a phenotypical characterization of the cmcs obtained from the cytobrushes was performed, verifying that the proportions of cd3+, cd4+ and cd8-t cells and cd4:cd8 ratio found in cmcs samples obtained hiv-neg women were comparable to those values reported previously62,63(see supplementary table s5). although few cmcs samples from hiv+ art+ women could be characterized, proportions of cd3+, cd4+ and cd8-t cells were similar to those found in hiv-neg (table s5).determinations in pbmcsproportions of th17 and treg cellscharacterization of these t-cell subsets was performed by flow cytometry following methods described previously by our group18, using thawed and overnight rested pbmcs dispensed in u-bottom 96-well plates (between 5 × 105 and 106 cells/well were used, depending on sample availability). th17 cells (defined as cd3+ cd4+ il-17+) were identified by intracellular cytokine staining (ics) after 6 hs of polyclonal stimulation at 37 °c with anti-cd3 and anti-cd28 abs (10 ng/ml each) and monensin (0,7 μl/ml; golgistop, bd biosciences). cell viability and surface cell staining consisted of 30 min incubation at 4 °c with live/dead fixable near-ir (invitrogen) and anti-cd3-pecy7 plus anti-cd4-percp respectively. then, ics was performed following the instructions of the cytofix/cytoperm kit (bd biosciences), incubated for 30 min at 4 °c with anti-il-17a-pe. unstimulated controls (medium only) were also included. treg cells (defined as cd4+ cd25+ foxp3+) were evaluated in unstimulated pbmcs, stained for 30 min at 4 °c with live/dead fixable near-ir (invitrogen), anti-cd3-percp, anti-cd4-fitc, anti-cd25-apc and anti-cd39-pecy7. for intranuclear staining, the human foxp3 staining kit (bd biosciences) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, after the fixation and permeabilization steps, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °c with anti-foxp3-pe. isotype-matched apc- and pe-conjugated non-specific abs were used in each sample to accurately set foxp3 and cd25 negative populations.t-cell activation proportionsimmune activation was defined as the percentage of cd38+ hla-dr+ t-cells (cd4 or cd8) and analyzed by flow cytometry. for this, thawed and overnight rested pbmcs were surface stained for 30 min at 4 °c with live/dead fixable near-ir (invitrogen), anti-cd3-pecy7, anti-cd4-percp, anti-cd8-pe, anti-cd38-apc and anti-hla-dr-fitc. isotype-matched fitc- and apc-conjugated non-specific abs were used in each sample to set cd38 and hla-dr negative populations.proportions of cd4+ cd161+ cellscharacterization of cd3+ cd4+ cd161+ cells was performed following the methodology described previously, briefly thawed and overnight rested pbmcs were surface stained during 30 min incubation at 4 °c with live/dead fixable near-ir (invitrogen), anti-cd3-pecy7, anti-cd4-percp and anti-cd161-apc.all fluorochrome-conjugated, isotype and co-stimulatory antibodies (abs) used in this study were obtained from bd biosciences (usa).gating strategyall samples were acquired in a 2-laser, 6-color bd facscanto flow cytometer and analyses were performed using the bd facsdiva software. instrument settings and fluorescence compensation were performed for each day of testing using unstained and single-stained samples. the same initial gating strategy was applied in all flow cytometry assays. the

G protein-coupled and ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium ion channels are essential for HIV entry,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40968-x,Research,11 March 2019,yes,"the high genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), has hindered the development of effective vaccines or antiviral drugs against it. hence, there is a continuous need for identification of new antiviral targets. hiv exploits specific host proteins also known as hiv-dependency factors during its replication inside the cell. potassium channels play a crucial role in the life cycle of several viruses by modulating ion homeostasis, cell signaling, cell cycle, and cell death. in this study, using pharmacological tools, we have identified that hiv utilizes distinct cellular potassium channels at various steps in its life cycle. members of inwardly rectifying potassium (kir) channel family, g protein-coupled (girk), and atp-sensitive (katp) are involved in hiv entry. blocking these channels using specific inhibitors reduces hiv entry. another member, kir 1.1 plays a role post entry as inhibiting this channel inhibits virus production and release. these inhibitors are not toxic to the cells at the concentration used in the study. we have further identified the possible mechanism through which these potassium channels regulate hiv entry by using a slow-response potential-sensitive probe dibac4(3) and have observed that blocking these potassium channels inhibits membrane depolarization which then inhibits hiv entry and virus release as well. these results demonstrate for the first time, the important role of kir channel members in hiv-1 infection and suggest that these k+ channels could serve as a safe therapeutic target for treatment of hiv/aids.
introduction nearly 25, fda approved drugs are available for the treatment of hiv/aids, but there is currently no cure for this disease1,2,3. hiv, being an rna virus is prone to mutations during reverse transcription leading to diversity in its genome. in addition to the ongoing issues of drug tolerability and long-term adverse effects, treatment of drug-resistant strains has become a major problem that has limited options for many patients. protease (pr) and reverse transcriptase (rt) inhibitors represent the backbone of the combination antiretroviral therapy4,5. however, during 15 years of widespread clinical applications, mutations that confer resistance to these drugs have accumulated. hence, identification of new antiviral target continues to be a high priority for development of hiv therapeutics.genome-wide sirna screen and protein-protein interaction studies have identified several cellular host factors required by hiv to perform different functions that are crucial for its replication6,7,8,9,10. in order to counteract hiv replication, it is important to target these host proteins as they are less prone to mutations compared to viral proteins. efforts are being made to block hiv-1 entry by targeting cellular receptors/coreceptors11,12 and counteracting host antiviral response by modulating the interaction of viral proteins with host restriction factors13. host ion channels (k+ and cl−) are an emerging class of host factors that play an essential role in regulating ion homeostasis across membranes and are involved in several cellular processes including cell cycle, cell signaling, and cellular gene expression. the k+ channels are broadly classified in two groups: voltage-gated and ligand-gated which are further classified in 4 subfamilies: voltage-gated k+ channels (kv), inwardly rectifying k+ channels (kir), two-pore k+ channels (k2p) and calcium-activated k+ channels (bk)14. these channels have been implicated to play a vital role during virus infection. enveloped viruses such as semliki forest virus and human rhinovirus type 2 modulate membrane potential for their entry and release from the host cell by modulating host ion channels during their life cycle15,16,17. certain viruses encode proteins called viroporins with ion channel properties whose function is essential for their life cycle making them ideal drug targets18,19. the hiv viral protein vpu displays k+ channel activity to enhance virus release20,21. additionally, the p13 protein encoded by htlv-1 targets mitochondrial membrane potential that results in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ros) by mitochondria22,23. the 6k protein encoded by ross river virus forms a cation-selective ion channel which plays a role in its release24,25. other viral proteins which display k+ channel activity to regulate virus infection include the 6 k protein of sindbis and semliki forest virus26 and dengue virus c terminal peptide27. modulation of potassium channels inhibits entry of ebola virus28 and replication of bunyavirus29. the potassium channels are also utilized by viruses to control cell death pathways. for example, the hepatitis c virus non-structural protein ns5a modulates the function of kv2.1, a voltage-gated k+ channel27 and regulates cell apoptosis. hiv-1 protein nef alters the intracellular k+ ion concentration30 by targeting large-conductance ca2+-dependent k+ channels (bkca)31 whereas viral env protein, gp120 inhibits the voltage-gated k+ channel (bec1) activity resulting in decreased virus release32. hiv gp120 induces hippocampal neuronal apoptosis by enhancement of kv channel functions through p38 mapk phosphorylation in hiv associated neurocognitive disorder33.in this study, we have systematically analyzed the role of k+ channels in the entry, replication, and release of hiv-1 virus using pharmacological tools. we have observed that members of the kir, girk and katp are involved in hiv entry whereas kir 1.1 plays a role in the release of hiv. we have also elucidated the mechanism of action of these channels and observed that blocking these channels inhibited membrane depolarization which reduced hiv entry. we propose that potassium channels may be further explored as new, pharmacologically safe hiv therapeutics.resultspotassium channels in hiv productionhiv-1 induces an increase in intracellular k+ concentration for efficient viral replication34. to determine this, we measured virus production in the presence of two potassium salts: kcl and k2so4. mt4 cells were infected with nl4-3 (hiv-1) and incubated in the presence of increasing concentration of kcl or k2so4 for 48 hrs. virus production was measured by detecting expression of the hiv-1 capsid protein, p24 by western blotting. an increase in salt concentration inhibited the virus production in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 1a–d). nearly 65–70% reduction in p24 was observed at 30 mm concentration of kcl or 20 mm k2so4 relative to β-actin. tea, a broad-spectrum potassium channel blocker35,36, reduced virus production by 90% (fig. 2a,b). these observations suggest that potassium channels may play a vital role in the life cycle of hiv.figure 1increased k+ ion concentration in media inhibits hiv production. (a,b) mt4 cells were infected with hiv (nl4-3) for 2 hrs and then incubated with indicated concentration of k+ salt for 48 hrs. the relative virus production was determined in cell lysate by western blotting.

(b) graphs represent the p24 band intensity normalised by β-actin. values represent relative change in p24 level ± sem derived from three independent experiments (*** denotes p < 0.001, anova).full size imagepotassium channels in hiv entrythere are three major steps in the virus life cycle: virus entry, replication, and release. we proposed to investigate the role of potassium channels in modulating these three significant steps of hiv life cycle using specific inhibitors as mentioned in table 1. 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) blocks kv channel activity by delaying the burst time of the channel37. the activity of kir 1.1 channels can be blocked by using bacl2. ba+ ions blocks cation movement by replacing the ion at the internal side of the central cavity of the channel38,39. bk channel activity can be inhibited by cocl2. cobalt inhibits the ca++ current which reduces the k+ current through bk channels38,39. katp and girk can be targeted by glibenclamide and ifenprodil respectively. glibenclamide blocks the channel activity from either side of the membrane40 while ifenprodil reversibly reduces the inward current by targeting girk from the extracellular side40.table 1 different potassium channel blockers used.full size tablewe first examined the effect of family-specific k+ channel blockers on hiv entry in the host cells. each blocker was used at a concentration which was not toxic to the cells (data not shown). for our experiments, we have used the most conventional system, the tzmbl assay which is based on the expression of the luciferase gene under the hiv-1 long terminal repeat (hiv-ltr) promoter. these cells have been widely used to study hiv entry and infection cycle. the tzmbl cells were pre-incubated with the indicated concentration of each blocker for 1 hr followed by hiv infection in the presence of the blockers for additional 2 hrs. the cells were washed post infection and further incubated for 48 hrs in the absence of blockers. virus production was estimated by measuring the luciferase gene expression. increased k+ ion concentration in media reduced virus entry by nearly 50%. the decrease in virus entry was not due to changes in osmolarity of the media as the addition of sucrose did not produce the same effect (fig. 3a). tea, a broad-spectrum k+ channel blocker inhibited hiv entry by 50%. interestingly, among all k+ family blockers, only ifenprodil, and glibenclamide reduced hiv entry by 50% which was reflected by decreased relative luminescence units (rlus) (fig. 3b). a similar decrease was observed even without pre-incubation with these compounds (fig. 3c). no effect on virus entry was observed with other k+ channel blockers, 4-ap, bacl2, and cocl2, indicating that these families are not involved in hiv entry. taken together, these results suggest that k+ channel subfamilies: katp and girk actively participate in hiv entry.figure 3effect of k+ channel inhibitors on hiv entry. (a,b) tzmbl cells were preincubated with increased concentration of kcl or k+ channel blockers (tea 5 mm, bacl2 1 mm, 4-ap 1 mm, cocl2 50 um, ifen 200 um, glib 200 um) for 1 hour followed by hiv infection. luciferase expression was measured in the cell lysates 48 hrs post infection.

(a) tzmbl cells were infected with hiv (nl4-3) followed by incubation for 48 hrs with kcl (20 and 40 mm) and sucrose (20 mm).

(a) hek293t cells were transfected with pnl4-3 and incubated with indicated concentration of k+ channel blockers for 24 hrs. the relative virus production was determined in supernatant and cell lysate by western blotting.

(a) tzmbl cells were infected with hiv in the presence or absence of valinomycin for 2 hrs. graphs represent the luminescence detected in the infected cells. (b) tzmbl cells were treated with valinomycin for 2 hrs followed by incubation with dibac4(3) (250 nm) for 30 min at room temperature (c) bar graph represent relative mean fluorescence in the cells. values represent relative change ± sem derived from 3 independent experiments (*** denotes p < 0.001, anova).full size imagerole of potassium channel blockers in modulating membrane potentialnext, we hypothesized that potassium channel blockers might also reduce virus entry by increased depolarization of cells. to test this hypothesis, we have measured membrane depolarization in the presence of various potassium channel blockers. we have observed that the inhibitors ifenprodil and glibenclamide depolarised the cells by reducing k+ efflux as evident from the increased fluorescence obtained with dibac4(3) (fig. 7a,b) in the absence of hiv-1. presence of ifenprodil during hiv infection further enhanced fluorescence. these results suggested that katp and girk channel family may play a role in hyperpolarization of cells which is essential for virus entry. similarly, presence of 4-ap also slightly increased membrane depolarisation suggesting its role during virus replication inside the cells (fig. 7c,d). presence of tea and other k+ family blockers had no effect on membrane potential. (fig. 7c,d).figure 7effect of k+ channel blockers on membrane potential. (a–c) hiv infected/uninfected tzmbl cells were treated with indicated concentration of the compounds for 2 hrs. the cells were incubated with dibac4(3) (250 nm) for 30 min at room temperature followed by facs analysis. (b–d) bar graphs represent relative mean fluorescence in the cells. values represent relative change ± sem derived from 3 independent experiments (** denotes p < 0.01; *** denotes p < 0.001, anova).full size imagediscussion potassium channels play a key role in maintaining k+ ion homeostasis and membrane potential and are involved in many cellular processes. these ion channels serve as an ideal therapeutic target in several diseases14. it has been previously reported that hiv virus production, in rh9 cells infected with hiv-1 strain lai, decreases with increasing kcl concentration in media suggesting that changes in extracellular potassium ions modulate hiv gene expression34, but the specific role of different potassium channel families during hiv life cycle is not known. in the current study, we have analyzed the role of specific k+ channel families at different steps in the hiv life cycle using available pharmacological inhibitors.we have observed that elevated concentration of both the k+ salts kcl and k2so4 reduced hiv virus production (fig. 1a–d). addition of broad-spectrum k+ channel blocker, tea also diminished virus production suggesting that the effect of k+ ions on virus production is specific and not due to changes in osmolarity which may also decrease cellular protein synthesis42. hence, these results imply that hiv may utilize multiple k+ channels during its life cycle (fig. 2a,b).the girk channels are present on the plasma membrane, and their opening is mediated by g protein-coupled receptors (gpcr)43. the gpcrs associated with girk are not involved in signal transduction pathways but directly activate these ion channels using effector proteins or the g protein subunits themselves. several gpcrs are members of the chemokine receptor subfamily. the hiv coreceptor ccr5 is an example of gpcr which is involved in hiv entry44. our study demonstrates that girk subfamily of potassium channels are involved in virus entry. blocking these channels with ifenprodil impeded hiv entry by 50% (fig. 3b).the katp channels are widely distributed and present in several tissues. their activity is regulated by the intracellular pool of adenine nucleotides linking cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. in the early steps of hiv infection, viral protein p2 increases the cellular atp pool which facilitates reverse transcription45. our results highlight that these channels play a significant role in hiv entry. blocking the katp channel with glibenclamide also inhibits viral entry (fig. 3b).changes in membrane potential regulate cell viability and cell cycle. role of membrane potential in the fusion and entry of semliki forest virus has been demonstrated15. hiv nef protein alters the membrane potential of the hiv infected cell. overexpression of nef hampers the activity of ca+2 dependent k+ channels45. another hiv protein, vpu, interacts with a cellular weak inward k+ rectifier task1 and plays a crucial role in the enhancement of virus release from the host cell by causing membrane potential depolarization46. hiv envelop protein, gp120, induces cell death in neuronal cells by targeting k+ channels46,47,48.to understand the role of membrane potential in hiv entry, we used a fluorescent membrane potential probe dibac 4(3) and observed that a k+ ionophore valinomycin inhibited hiv entry by increasing membrane depolarization. this suggests that membrane hyperpolarisation is essential for hiv entry. we observed a similar increase in membrane depolarization in the presence of both ifenprodil and glibenclamide implying that these compounds may also block virus entry by depolarization of the membrane (fig. 7a,b). this is the first report of a possible mechanism of action of ifenprodil. glibenclamide is already being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and works by causing membrane depolarization in pancreatic cells leading to release of insulin47,48,49. however, other mechanisms of action of these compounds through cell signaling or any other pathway needs to be further investigated.the kv channels play a role in the progression of hiv associated dementia (had)33,50. blocking the kv channels with 4-ap inhibited intracellular virus production (fig. 4b).it is interesting to note that a non-specific k+ channel blocker tea, inhibited hiv production without altering membrane potential inferring that there might be other mechanism involved in this process also (figs 3b and 7c,d).together, our study highlights the important role played by kir channel families at different steps in the hiv life cycle and suggest these kir channels may be pursued as new therapeutic targets for hiv infection.conclusion to address the challenge of drug resistance, it is necessary to unravel new targets that could be developed as alternate hiv therapeutics. we have demonstrated that kir potassium channels play a vital role at different steps of hiv life cycle and could serve as novel targets for the better management of hiv/aids.methodscells, virus, and drugsmt4 cells were propagated in rpmi1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (fbs). tzm-bl and

Activity and structural analysis of GRL-117C: a novel small molecule CCR5 inhibitor active against R5-tropic HIV-1s,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41080-w,Research,18 March 2019,yes,"ccr5 is a member of the g-protein coupled receptor family that serves as an essential co-receptor for cellular entry of r5-tropic hiv-1, and is a validated target for therapeutics against hiv-1 infections. in the present study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel small ccr5 inhibitors and evaluated their antiviral activity. grl-117c inhibited the replication of wild-type r5-hiv-1 with a sub-nanomolar ic50 value. these derivatives retained activity against vicriviroc-resistant hiv-1s, but did not show activity against maraviroc (mvc)-resistant hiv-1. structural modeling indicated that the binding of compounds to ccr5 occurs in the hydrophobic cavity of ccr5 under the second extracellular loop, and amino acids critical for their binding were almost similar with those of mvc, which explains viral cross-resistance with mvc. on the other hand, one derivative, grl-10018c, less potent against hiv-1, but more potent in inhibiting cc-chemokine binding, occupied the upper region of the binding cavity with its bis-thf moiety, presumably causing greater steric hindrance with cc-chemokines. recent studies have shown additional unique features of certain ccr5 inhibitors such as immunomodulating properties and hiv-1 latency reversal properties, and thus, continuous efforts in developing new ccr5 inhibitors with unique binding profiles is necessary.
introduction small molecule ccr5 inhibitors cause allosteric changes in the conformation of ccr5, which is a critical coreceptor involved in the binding of the gp120/cd4 complex, allowing ccr5 inhibitors to block the fusion between cellular and viral membranes, and inhibit the entry of hiv-11,2,3. as their names suggest, entry inhibitors block entry of hiv-1 into the cells, and are distinct from other classes of hiv-1 inhibitors, such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (rtis), integrase inhibitors (inis), and protease inhibitors (pis), all of which block hiv-1 replication following its entry into the cell1,2. therefore, ccr5 inhibitors are considered to be effective against wild-type hiv-1 species as well as hiv-1 variants that are resistant to existing classes of anti-retroviral drugs including most recent inis. in addition, if properly combined with other classes of anti-retroviral drugs, ccr5 inhibitors are expected to exert synergistic effects4,5.as for drug-resistance against ccr5 inhibitors, a clinical trial (merit study) for maraviroc (mvc) showed that the level of mvc resistance was low, and that the virologic failure observed was mainly caused by the emergence of pre-existing x4-hiv-1 that was not detected by the tropism assay6. however, some groups have reported that ccr5 inhibitor-resistant viruses can be developed in vitro7,8,9,10. trkola et al., and marozsan et al., reported the generation of hiv-1 escape mutants for ad101 (experimental ccr5 inhibitor) and sch-d (vicriviroc or vvc). they also found that such escape mutant viruses did not use cxcr4, but instead gained the ability to use ccr5 in a ccr5 inhibitor-insensitive manner7,8,11. westby et al., reported the selection of an mvc-resistant virus with mutations in the v3 loop of hiv-gp120 that acquired resistance without tropism shift from r5 to x49. these results suggest that long-term usage of mvc may result in the emergence of mvc-resistant r5 hiv-1s.currently, mvc is the only ccr5 inhibitor in clinical use. mvc was first approved by the fda as the first-in-class ccr5 inhibitor in 2007. however, mvc has some disadvantages as an anti-hiv drug. one limitation of mvc is that it needs to be dosed twice daily, whereas other recent hiv-1 drugs such as tenofovir (rti), dolutegravir (ini), and darunavir (pi) need to be administered once a day only. in addition, patients must be examined for viral tropism in their body before starting a treatment with mvc. thus, mvc is currently not often used in clinic compared to other conventional anti-hiv drugs.in the meantime, recent studies have shown a possibility of the usage of ccr5 inhibitors besides that of a conventional anti-hiv drug. another potent ccr5 inhibitor, cenicriviroc (tbr-652 or cvc)12 was reported to interact with ccr2 as well, which is associated with inflammation-related diseases, and is expected to be a potential inflammatory mediator12. in fact, krenkel et al., reported therapeutic effects of inhibiting monocyte infiltration in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) models by using cvc to inhibit the recruitment of kupffer cells and monocyte-derived cells13. on the other hand, the administration of mvc also reportedly results in the increase of cd4+ t-cell counts in the blood, which was considered a possible advantage that may contribute to increased immunological functions14. moreover, another group recently reported that mvc reversed hiv-1 latency in vitro alone or in combination with a pkc agonist15, suggesting a possibility of the utility of mvc as a latency-reversing agent. however, such effects of ccr5 (ccr2) inhibitors on chemokine-induced cellular/immunological function are considered to be very complicated and exact mechanisms underlying such phenomenon are not known. thus, the development of new ccr5 inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetics (once-daily regimens), unique binding profiles to ccr5, and unique immunological features is desired.in this study, we report several novel small molecule ccr5 inhibitors that demonstrate potent anti-r5-hiv-1 activity. we also elucidated their binding mode and interactions with ccr5, and compared their biological/structural characteristics with that of mvc.resultsactivity of grl-117c and its derivatives against r5 hiv-1we designed and synthesized small molecule compounds as candidates for novel ccr5 inhibitors, and identified several compounds that have potent activity against wild type r5-hiv-1. grl-117c exerted potent activity against r5-hiv-1ba-l with a sub-nanomolar ic50 value in the magi assay using magi/ccr5 cells. the potency (ic50 values) of grl-117c was comparable to that of mvc, as was determined by both the magi assay (0.6 nm vs. 0.7 nm) and the p24 assay with pbmcs (8.1 nm vs. 4.5 nm). apl16,17 demonstrated similar or slightly more potent activity than mvc, and its ic50 values were 0.2 nm and 2.6 nm for the magi and p24 assays, respectively. the other grl-compounds, grl-10007c and grl-10018c, also demonstrated strong activity against hiv-1ba-l in the magi assay (ic50: 1.4 nm and 2.9 nm, respectively). these compounds were found to be more potent compared to the two previously published experimental ccr5 inhibitors, sch-c and tak-779, but were less effective than mvc and apl (table 1). two drug-naïve clinical r5-hiv-1 strains, cc1/85 cl.6 and cl.7, were also used in the assays7,8. all the compounds tested in this study showed similar effectiveness against the cc1/85 clinical strains compared to hiv-1ba-l (table 1). we have previously observed that the ic50 value(s) of ccr5 inhibitors in magi assays18 tended to be lower compared to those obtained via the p24 assays in pbmcs16,19. in this study, we also observed the same trend. for example, the ic50 value of grl-117c for the magi assay was 0.6 nm, but was 8.1 nm for the p24 assay (hiv-1ba-l) (table 1).table 1 activity of ccr5 inhibitors against hiv-1s, including ccr5 inhibitor-resistant hiv-1s.full size tableactivity of ccr5 inhibitors against transmitter/founder (t/f) hiv-1swe also examined the activity of grl-compounds against transmitter/founder (t/f) hiv-1 viruses. t/f viruses are involved in the initial infection. it is considered that t/f viruses virtually always use ccr5 rather than cxcr4 and infect t cells but not macrophages because high level of cd4 is needed to mediate virus entry for the initial transmission20,21,22,23,24. thus, ccr5 inhibitors are expected to be active against such t/f viruses. we obtained four hiv-1 t/f infectious clones. we determined the antiviral activity of grl-117c, grl-10007c and grl-10018c on these hiv-1 clones using magi assay. we also determined the activity of maraviroc and apl against these viruses. as shown in table 2, grl-ccr5 inhibitors, especially grl-117c, exerted potent activity against all four t/f viruses. maraviroc and apl were also highly potent. the ic50 values of grl-117c were 1.9–3.2 nm, and were substantially similar to the activity of mvc (1.7–2.3 nm) against these cells (table 2).table 2 activity of ccr5 inhibitors against transmitted/founder (t/f) hiv-1s.full size tableactivity of ccr5 inhibitors against ccr5 inhibitor-resistant hiv-1swe selected three compounds (grl-117c, grl-10007c, and grl-10018c) (fig. 1) for further testing. in a previous study, trkola et al., reported the generation of an escape mutant hiv-1 for ad101 (experimental ccr5 inhibitor), and found that this mutant did not use cxcr4, but instead gained the ability to use ccr5 in an ad101-insensitive manner7. subsequently, marozsan et al., described the generation of escape mutants under the selection pressure of vvc in vitro8. both escape mutants were fully resistant against ad101 and vvc7,8. for the current study, ad101- and vvc-resistant hiv clones were provided by dr. john p. moore of cornell university. as shown in table 1, cc101.19 (ad101-resistant) was approximately 150-fold more resistant to sch-c (ic50: >1,000 nm) compared to its corresponding ccr5 inhibitor-sensitive viruses, cc1/85 (cl.6 and cl7, ic50: 5.2 and 6.1 nm, respectively). on the other hand, resistance against other ccr5 inhibitors, including mvc, apl, and grl-compounds, were relatively lower in comparison; fold resistance ranged from 2.6- to 15-fold. the vvc-resistant virus (d1/85.16) also showed high resistance against sch-c (68-fold), but remained susceptible to all other drugs to some extent (fold resistance: 3.6-fold to 12.5-fold). grl-117c exhibited slightly decreased activity against ad101- and vvc-resistant viruses (fold resistance: 9.3- and 8.5-fold, respectively), however, its ic50 numbers remained less than 40 nm. interestingly, grl-10007c, which was less reactive than grl-117c against wild type r5-hiv-1, maintained its activity against ad101- and vvc-resistant viruses, showing ic50 values of 41.1 nm (2.6-fold) and 56.9 nm (3.6-fold) (table 1). this result suggested that the resistance profiles of sch-c and its associated drugs (vvc and ad101) differ drastically from those of mvc, apl, and grl-derivatives. grl-10007c, which induced the least resistance in these viruses, may have a unique resistance profile among the ccr5 inhibitors tested in this study.figure 1structures of grl-ccr5 inhibitors (grl-117c, grl-10007c, and grl-10018c) and apl (aplaviroc), mvc (maraviroc), vvc (vicriviroc), ad101, and cvc (cenicriviroc).full size imagewe then wanted to determine if these compounds are effective against hiv-1s carrying mvc-resistance-associated substitutions. as shown in fig. 2 and table 3, activity of grl-117c was reduced when used against the highly mvc-resistant virus (hiv-1kp-5mvcr) (ic50: 686 nm). however, grl-117c also demonstrated decreased activity against a drug-naïve hiv-1 clinical strain (hiv-1kp-5pc) as compared to the laboratory hiv-1 strain (hiv-1yu2) (table 3). therefore, while the fold change of ic50 values for grl-117c was only 4.8 between hiv-1kp-5pc and hiv-1kp-5mvcr, we concluded that grl-117c had cross-resistance with mvc, because its ic50 value against hiv-1kp-5mvcr (686 nm) was more than 10-fold greater than that of mvc (41 nm) (table 3). the other derivatives, grl-10007c and grl-10018c also failed to demonstrate activity against hiv-1kp-5mvcr (data not shown). it is of note that the activity of cvc against hiv-1kp-5mvcr was substantially decreased compared to that of wild type [ic50: 260 nm vs. 4.1 nm (×63-fold)], indicating that it also has cross-resistance with mvc (table 3).figure

experiments.full size imagetable 3 activity of ccr5 inhibitors against hiv-1s, including mvc-resistant hiv-1.full size tablegrl-ccr5 inhibitors inhibit the binding of cc-chemokines to ccr5in order to determine whether grl derivatives block the binding of cc-chemokines to ccr5, we conducted a cc-chemokine binding inhibition assay using 125i-labeled cc-chemokines (125i-rantes, 125i-mip-1α, and 125i-mip-1β) and ccr5 expressing cells. all the ccr5 inhibitors tested (grl-117c, grl-10007c, grl-10018c, mvc, and apl) blocked the binding of 125i mip-1α to ccr5, and their ec50 values ranged from 0.1–4.3 nm. similar results were observed for mip-1β binding (ec50 range: 0.2–2.5 nm) (fig. 3 and table 4). results demonstrated that mvc, apl, and grl-10018c exert stronger inhibitory effects on mip-1α and mip-1β binding compared to grl-117c and grl-10007c. in contrast, apl, grl-117c, and grl-10007c only moderately blocked the binding of rantes; their ec50 values were 156, 121, and 628 nm, respectively (table 4), and binding of 125i-rantes remained at more than 40% even in the presence of 1 μm of grl-10007c (fig. 3). we have previously reported that apl does not effectively inhibit the binding and function of rantes, even though it binds to ccr516. it is possible that grl-10007c and grl-117c also have similar profiles as apl in terms of their role in cc-chemokine to ccr5 binding.figure 3inhibition of 125i-labeled cc-chemokine binding to ccr5 by ccr5 inhibitors. ccr5+ cho cells were incubated with (a) 125i-mip-1α, (b) 125i-mip-1β, and (c) 125i-rantes (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of ccr5 inhibitors. data are shown as means ± s.d. of three independent experiments.full size imagetable 4 inhibition of cc-chemokine binding by ccr5 inhibitors.full size tabledetermination of the binding site and binding profile of grl-117c via structural analysisthree-dimensional models of human ccr5-ccr5 inhibitor complexes were defined using the crystal structure of ccr5-mvc as the template (pdb id: 4mbs)25. as was previously reported by tan et al., mvc was found to be lodged in the bottom of the largest pocket at the binding site, which was defined by residues from helices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (fig. 4a and ref.25). it was observed that mvc forms hydrogen bonds with tyr-37, tyr-251, and glu-283, and its phenyl group reaches deep into the pocket to form hydrophobic interactions with aromatic residues such as tyr-108, trp-248, and tyr-251 (fig. 4a and ref.25). as shown in fig. 4b, grl-117c also binds to the same binding cavity, and similar to mvc, grl-117c forms hydrogen bonds with tyr-37 and glu-283, but not with tyr-251. binding models of grl-10018c with ccr5 also showed formation of hydrogen bonds between grl-10018c and tyr-37 and glu-283 (fig. 4c). on the other hand, overall, apl binds in the same active site cavity as previously reported26,27. there are polar interactions with tyr-37, ser-180 and thr-195. tyr-108, tyr-251 and glu-283 are part of the binding pocket and form non-polar interactions with apl (fig. 4d)figure 4binding pocket of ccr5. a side view of ccr5 with the bound ccr5 inhibitor is shown. (a) mvc, (b) grl-117c, (c) grl-10018c, and (d) apl in the binding pocket of ccr5 are illustrated. (upper) the transmembrane (tm) domains and the second extracellular loop (ecl2) are indicated. (center) detailed interactions between a ccr5 inhibitor and ccr5 residues are shown. the bis-thf moiety of grl-10018c (c) locates upper region of the binding cavity. apl (d) has hydrogen-bond interactions with y37, s180 and t195 (bottom) interactions of each ccr5 inhibitor (mvc, grl-117c, and grl-10018c) with y37, e283, and y251. yellow dot: hydrogen-bonding.full size imageas described, grl compounds (117c and 10018c) and mvc have hydrogen-bond interactions with tyr-37 and glu-283 (fig. 4a–c). mvc also has a hydrogen-bonding with tyr-251 (fig. 4a). on the other hand, for grl-117c and 10018 c, there are weak non-polar interactions and very weak pi-pi interactions between the phenyl groups of grl-compounds and tyr-251 (fig. 4b,c), thus making slightly different binding profiles of grl-compounds to the ccr5 binding cavity comparing to that of mvc. as was also described in the previous section, grl-10018c exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on the binding of the three chemokines as compared to grl-117c and grl-10007c (fig. 3 and table 4). this may be due to the fact that grl-10018c possesses a bis-thf structure. the bulky rings occupying the upper region of the binding cavity under ecl2 cause steric hindrance with cc-chemokine when it binds to ccr5. however, the bis-thf structure does not affect the interaction between gp120 with ccr5. moreover, as was previously reported by tan et al., the phenyl group of mvc form hydrophobic interactions with trp-248, thus preventing its activation-related motion (fig. 4a)25. similarly, grl-117c and grl-10018 also have a phenyl ring in the center of their structure that forms hydrophobic interactions with trp-248; it is therefore possible that grl-derivatives also prevent activation-related motion of ccr5.discussion in the present study, we investigated a series of novel small ccr5 inhibitors that are active against r5-hiv-1, including ccr5 inhibitor-resistant hiv-1s. while proof-of-principle studies have shown that ccr5 inhibitors can be effective against hiv-1 infections and aids, the use of ccr5 inhibitors still raises some concerns. one issue is the acquisition of resistance against ccr5 inhibitors. previous studies have suggested two possible mechanisms by which resistance against ccr5 inhibitors is acquired: i) tropism change (x4-hiv-1 becomes predominant in the patient body), and ii) emergence r5-hiv-1 variants that can utilize “drug-bound” ccr5 for viral entry into the cell2,9,10,11. in mvc-resistant virus, westby et al., found that an isolate had a316t and i323v mutations in the v3 loop of gp120. in addition, the resistant virus strain exhibited a unique profile; while a decrease in maximal inhibition with mvc was observed, its ic50 value did not shift substantially9. it is possible that this may be due to the noncompetitive profiles of mvc and vvc inhibition. even in the presence of ccr5 inhibitors, the resistant virus was able to bind to the ccr5-drug complex (drug-bound ccr5)9,10,11. in the present study, we also observed drastic increase of ic90 number of mvc against mvc-resistant strain (table 2), and it is possibly due to “drug-bound ccr5” utilization mechanism (fig. 2). we also demonstrated that activity of grl-117c was reduced against highly mvc-resistant virus (hiv-1kp-5mvcr) (ic50: 686 nm) (table 3). however, grl-117c also showed reduced activity against the drug-naïve hiv-1 clinical strain (hiv-1kp-5pc) as compared to the laboratory hiv-1 strain (hiv-1yu2) (table 3). taken together, it is predicted that the activity/resistance profile of grl-117c is basically the same but slightly different from that of mvc, presumably because of their slightly different binding profiles to ccr5, as shown in fig. 4. on the other hand, westby et al., reported that mvc-resistant recombinant viruses retained sensitivity to apl, another experimental ccr5 inhibitor9,16. aside from the residues in the deeper tm domains (e.g., glu-283), apl also interacts with residues in ecl2 (e.g., cys-178, ser-180, and lys-191)26, resulting in a significantly different binding mode to that of mvc (fig. 4a). this may imply that optimization of recent ccr5 inhibitors with modified binding modes similar/close to apl may result in better activity against mvc-resistant viruses.as discussed above, the acquisition of drug-resistance against ccr5 inhibitors in viruses is a serious problem. however, recent studies have reported that ccr5 inhibitor-resistant viruses are sensitive to neutralization via the v3 and cd4i epitopes10,28. in addition, yoshimura et al. suggested that the neutralizing epitopes on mvc-resistant viruses with a greater number of mutations could be more efficiently exposed for such mabs10. these findings suggest that ccr5 inhibitors may be used to enhance the effect of mab neutralization or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (adcc) activity10.the binding modes of the inhibitors presented here were determined by docking to a crystal structure of ccr5 (pdb id: 4mbs)25 (please see methods section for details). we carried out validation studies to make sure glide, the docking program used here, is able to generate accurate docking poses by docking maraviroc back into the crystal structure of ccr5. in fact, there is no difference in the binding mode of mvc obtained by our docking protocol from the binding mode observed in the crystal structure. grl-117c, grl-10018c, and grl-10007c share a common substructure with mvc. this substructure occupies the same region of the binding cavity for both mvc as well as the grl-inhibitors studied here. moreover, the phenyl group of tyr-251 has non-polar interactions with a phenyl moiety of grl-117c, grl-10018c, and grl-10007c and mvc (fig. 4a–c).in general, binding studies on mutant residues can give very useful information on binding interactions of specific residues with inhibitors. however, tyr-108, tyr-251 and glu-283 present in the binding pocket of ccr5 pose challenges. our previous studies26,27 have shown the importance of tyr-251 in maintaining the shape of the binding cavity. tyr-251 and glu-283 are also important in the interaction of ccr5 with chemokines and gp120. tyr-251 and glu-283 form polar interactions with each other and are responsible for maintaining the optimum shape of the cavity25,26,27. mutagenesis is very likely to disrupt this optimal shape, and interfere with binding. the crystal structure of ccr5-mvc showed the importance of tyr-251 and glu-283 in the binding pocket as well as the hydrophobic interaction by the phenyl group of mvc with tyr-25125. thus, we consider that the modeling of grl compounds to ccr5 using mvc-ccr5 co-crystal as a template shown in this study is reliable enough without mutagenesis data.as ccr5 is an important co-receptor for the cellular entry of hiv, it is considered that the prophylactic use of ccr5 inhibitors is a potential strategy to prevent hiv transmission. transmitter/founder (t/f) viruses are involved in the initial infection, and virtually always use ccr5 rather than cxcr4 and infect t cells but not macrophages. in addition, parker et al. reported that the chronically-infected viruses had envelopes that exhibited partial resistance to mvc (52%), while, only 15% of t/f viruses exhibited that property23, suggesting higher sensitivity of t/f viruses to mvc. in fact, the data presented in this study also showed the potent activity of ccr5 inhibitors, including grl-ccr5 inhibitors, against t/f viruses (table 2).to develop an effective prevention strategy using ccr5 inhibitors, herrera et al. performed ex-vivo preclinical evaluation using colorectal tissue explants to determine the efficacy of mvc in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors (rtis) and found that the drug combination(s) inhibited hiv-1 transmission at viral entry29. brocca-cofano et al. examined the effect of mvc on simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) transmission to infant macaques. however, the authors found that mvc had only a marginal effect in inhibiting the transmission of a t/f variant and a minimal impact on the postinfection delay of viremia following oral siv infection30. the result suggests that more studies are needed to develop optimal prevention strategies using entry inhibitors. it is also possible that the partial effect of mvc is due to a limited efficacy of the drug, and more effective novel ccr5 inhibitors may have a better effect in preventing hiv transmission30,31.another concern for the use of ccr5 inhibitors is the long-term safety associated with blockage of ccr5, a receptor whose function is not yet fully understood in healthy individuals. we have previously shown that apl only partially blocks the ccr5-dependent binding and signal induction of rantes16. in the present study, we showed that grl-117c and grl-10007c also only moderately blocked the binding of rantes (table 4), suggesting that they may have similar profiles as apl in terms of cc-chemokine binding inhibition. on the other hand, grl-10018c showed quite different profile of chemokine binding inhibition (fig. 3).cvc, another ccr5 inhibitor currently under clinical trials32, was recently reported to interact with ccr2 as well, and is expected to be a potential inflammation mediator12. moreover, mvc is also known to increase cd4+ t-cell counts in the blood14. this may suggest a possibility that some of the grl-ccr5 inhibitors (e.g. grl-10018c) may be optimized as a new ccr5 inhibitor that has some additional usage such as cvc. however, such effects of ccr5 inhibitors on chemokine-induced cellular/immunological function are very complicated and clinical outcomes are difficult to predict, thus, careful long-term observation is needed for its clinical use.currently, mvc and enfuvirtide, an oligopeptide fusion inhibitor, are the only drugs that have been approved for clinical use as entry inhibitors. in addition, cvc, an oral, once-daily drug, was reported that it was effective and safe in the treatment of naïve hiv-1-infected subjects in a 48-week phase 2b trial32. however, most recent clinical trials of cvc are likely for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases such as nash13. on the other hand, the development of other entry inhibitors, especially cxcr4 inhibitors, will also improve the utility of ccr5 inhibitors. in the present study, we have demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy and safety of newly reported potent ccr5 inhibitors with a different chemical structure from known ccr5 inhibitors. they also had different profiles in the cc-chemokine-binding inhibition or hiv-1 drug-resistance profile compared to those of mvc or apl. apl was dropped from clinical trials because of its severe hepatotoxicity, and such difference may result in a very different in vivo toxicity profile of grl compounds. it is also important to develop more potent and metabolically stable ccr5 inhibitors with once-daily (qd) dosing regimens in order to complement the limitations of mvc in future.in summary, the data generated in this study should help to design novel ccr5 inhibitors that are safe and active against all drug-resistant hiv-1s, which is very important as a countermeasure against possible occurrences of resistance to dolutegravir and other currently used anti-hiv drugs. moreover, such detailed structural analysis may help us to understand the effects of chemokine receptor inhibitors on various immunological functions and pursue possible usages of them as immunomodulators or latent hiv-1 reversing agents.methodsreagentsthree newly designed and synthesized ccr5 inhibitors, grl-117c, grl-10007c, and grl-10018c (fig. 1) are discussed in the present report. the methods for their synthesis and physicochemical profiles will be described elsewhere. the structures of these three compounds are shown in fig. 1. a previously reported, spirodiketopiperazine (sdp) derivative, aplaviroc (apl) [4-[4-[(3 r)-1-butyl-3-[(1 r)cyclohexylhydroxymethyl]-2,5-dioxo-1,4,9-triazaspiro [5.5] undec-9 ylmethyl] phenoxy] benzoic acid hydrochloride]16,33, was used as a reference compound. maraviroc (mvc), tak-779, and sch-c (sch-351125) were synthesized as previously described34,35,36.cells and virusesmagi-ccr5 cells18 were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs: gemini bio-products, west sacramento, ca), 200 μg/ml g418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin b, and 100 μg/ml zeomycin. the chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells expressing ccr519 were maintained in ham’s f-12 medium (gibco-brl, rockville, md) supplemented with 10% fcs, 50 u/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence of 5 μg/ml blasticidin s hydrochloride. tzm-bl cells were obtained from the nih aids reagent program, and were cultured in dmem with 10% fcs. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated from buffy coats of hiv-1 seronegative individuals, and were activated with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (pha) prior to use16. a laboratory wild-type r5-hiv-1 strain (hiv-1ba-l)37 was employed for drug susceptibility assays. ad101 (experimental ccr5 inhibitor) and vvc-resistant hiv clones7,8 were provided by dr. john p. moore of cornell university for this study. the clones were propagated with activated pbmcs, and were used for the assays. a clinical hiv-1 strain, hiv-1kp-5pc, and an mvc-resistant isolate, hiv-1kp-5mvcr, were prepared and used for antiviral assays, as previously described10,38. the following reagents (plasmids) for t/f hiv-1 viruses22,24 were obtained through the nih aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih: pch040.c/2625 (cat# 11740), pch106.c/2633 (cat# 11743), pthro.c/2626 (cat# 11745), and pch058.c/2960 (cat# 11856), from dr. john kappes and dr. christina ochsenbauer.anti-hiv-1 assayantiviral assays using pha-pbmcs (p24 assay) were conducted as previously reported16,38. in brief, pha-pbmcs (1 × 106/ml) were exposed to 50 tcid50 of hiv-1ba-l or drug-resistant hiv-1 infectious clones in the presence or absence of various concentrations of drugs; 10-fold serial dilutions were performed in 96-well microculture plates. the amount of p24 antigens produced by the cells was determined on day 7 in the culture via a commercially available elisa kit (perkinelmer). the p24 production level in drug-free control cell cultures was used as the reference. drug concentrations that resulted in 50% reduction (ic50) in p24 antigen production were determined. antiviral assays using magi-ccr5 cells (magi assay) were conducted as previously reported16,39. single-round virus infection assays using tzm-bl cells infected with r5-hiv-1s (hiv-1yu2, hiv-1kp-5pc, and hiv-1kp-5mvcr)10 were also conducted as previously described25.inhibition of chemokine binding to ccr5the inhibition of the binding of 125i-labeled cc-chemokines ([125i] rantes, [125i] mip-1α, or [125i] mip-1β) to ccr5 by various ccr5 inhibitors was measured as previously described16. calcium flux inhibition assays were also performed with ccr5 inhibitors, and were carried out with the fluo-4 directtm calcium reagent (invitrogen); assays were conducted as previously described with minor modifications40. in brief, cho-ccr5 cells (5 × 105 cells) were exposed to fluo-4 directtm calcium reagent for 60 min at 37 °c in rpmi containing 5% fcs. cells were then incubated with the test compound for 30 min at varying concentrations. subsequently, cells were exposed to either mip-1α, mip-1β, or rantes at 200 ng/ml. relative increases in cytosolic ca2+ levels after chemokine exposure were determined with flow cytometry (facscalibur, bd biosciences), and ic50 values of cytosolic ca2+ mobilization (ca2+ flux) were compared with the ca2+ flux level in drug-free control samples.structural modeling of interactions between ccr5 inhibitors and ccr5crystal structure of ccr5 reported by tan et al.

Cellular TRIM33 restrains HIV-1 infection by targeting viral integrase for proteasomal degradation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08810-0,Research,25 February 2019,yes,"productive hiv-1 replication requires viral integrase (in), which catalyzes integration of the viral genome into the host cell dna. in, however, is short lived and is rapidly degraded by the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. to identify the cellular factors responsible for hiv-1 in degradation, we performed a targeted rnai screen using a library of sirnas against all components of the ubiquitin-conjugation machinery using high-content microscopy. here we report that the e3 ring ligase trim33 is a major determinant of hiv-1 in stability. cd4-positive cells with trim33 knock down show increased hiv-1 replication and proviral dna formation, while those overexpressing the factor display opposite effects. knock down of trim33 reverts the phenotype of an hiv-1 molecular clone carrying substitution of in serine 57 to alanine, a mutation known to impair viral dna integration. thus, trim33 acts as a cellular factor restricting hiv-1 infection by preventing provirus formation.
introduction integration into the host cell genome, which is catalyzed by the virus-encoded integrase (in) enzyme, is a hallmark of all members of the retroviridae family1,2. in both lenti- and gamma- retroviruses, functionally active in is a product of endo-proteolytic cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein by action of the virally encoded protease. as a result of this process, in the case of hiv-1, mature in harbors an n-terminal phenylalanine, which renders the protein susceptible to rapid degradation by the 26s proteasome following recognition by the class of e3 ubiquitin ligases known as recognins (n-end rule ubiquitin e3 ligases), which recognize n-degron signals3,4. when the first amino-acid of hiv-1 in is mutated to methionine, in stability increases, however the protein is still short-lived4,5,6,7,8, an indication that in is targeted for degradation through the proteasomal pathway also independent from n-terminal recognition. indeed, this conclusion  is consistent with the long-standing observation that inhibition of the proteasome enhances hiv-1 infection9,10.the 160-kda hiv-1 gag-pol polyprotein is packaged into virions preceding proteolytic processing, which occurs in the virions after budding. upon target cell infection, mature in (32 kda) is part of the viral pre-integration complex (pic), which provides a secluded environment where reverse transcription of viral rna into blunt-ended, linear dna takes place11. part of the pic is then transported into the nucleus, where viral in eventually exerts its enzymatic function. here, the protein enters in contact with various nuclear proteins, including factors that increase its efficacy and protect it against proteasomal degradation. these include the transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription coactivator p75 (ledgf/p75)5,12,13 and ku70, a component of the cellular double-stranded dna break repair through the non-homologous end-joining pathway14. for both factors, binding to in was shown to prevent its proteasomal degradation7,14.in addition, our previous work has shown that in stability, and thus enzymatic function, is increased by post-translational modification. phosphorylation of serine 57 (s57) in the in catalytic core by cellular c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) renders the protein a substrate for cis/trans isomerization by the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase pin1; this induced structural modification markedly increases in half-life by reducing its ubiquitination and is required for efficient hiv-1 infection15. a point mutation in in(s57) leads to accelerated in degradation and severely restricts infectivity of the virus. consistent with the stabilizing role of jnk-induced in(s57) phosphorylation, lack of jnk expression restricts viral infection in resting, primary cd4+ t lymphocytes15.taken together, these studies indicate that, in the infected cells, in is a substrate for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. this pathway consists in the sequential action of three different classes of enzymes. the 76 aa-polypeptide ubiquitin is first activated by binding to one of a few e1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, to be then transferred to one of ~40 e2 conjugation enzymes, which act in conjunction with over 600 e3 ubiquitin protein ligases, which provide target specificity by recognizing the proteins to be tagged and eventually transferring ubiquitin to them16,17,18,19. the poly-ubiquitinated substrate proteins are then recognized by the 26s proteasome machinery and degraded into short peptides20. e3 ligases are classified into two main classes (ring and hect) based on conserved structural domains and the molecular mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate. the ring (really interesting new gene)-type e3 ligases catalyze direct transfer of ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-loaded e2 enzyme to the substrate, concurrently binding with the cognate e2 and the substrate17,21. in contrast, the hect (homology to e6ap c-terminus)-type e3 ligases require two steps to transfer ubiquitin to the substrate, with ubiquitin being first transferred from the e2 to an active site cysteine in the e3 and then from the e3 to the substrate22,23.as a consequence of this mechanism, it can be predicted that, in hiv-1 susceptible cells, one or more cellular e3 ligases must exist, in addition to those involved in n-terminal recognition, which target in for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thus hampering hiv-1 infection by impairing viral cdna integration. the identity of these e3 ligases, however, has escaped identification so far.here we report the results of a high-throughput screening (hts) using a library of sirnas against the whole set of components of the ubiquitin-conjugation machinery, including e1 and e2 enzymes and e3 ring and hect ligases (598 target genes) using high-content microscopy, in search for factors that drive in ubiquitination and degradation. we report that the cellular e3 ring ligase trim33 is a major determinant of hiv-1 in stability inside the cells binding the in carboxy-terminal domain through its ring portion and determining its poly-ubiquitination. lack of trim33 overcomes the effect of pin1 knock-down and rescues infectivity of an hiv-1 mutant carrying the destabilizing in (s57) mutation. thus, trim33 acts as an inhibitory factor hampering hiv-1 infection by decreasing in function and thus preventing viral cdna integration into the host cell genome.resultscellular ubiquitin-proteasome targets hiv-1 in for degradationwe examined hiv-1 in protein stability in hela cells upon transfection of a plasmid expressing flag-tagged in15 in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor mg132 in cells treated with cycloheximide (chx, 30 μg/ml), which blocks de novo protein synthesis. the levels of in progressively diminished over time, with an estimated half-life of ~60 min, in line with our previous results15; proteasome inhibition maintained high protein levels over time (fig. 1a for experimental scheme, fig. 1b representative immunoblot and fig. 1c for quantification of three independent experiments). the levels of egfp expressed from a separate plasmid transfected together with in in the same cells were unaffected by the treatments and remained stable over time (fig. 1b). in similar experiments, the half-life of in from the moloney-murine leukemia virus (mlv) gammaretrovirus was > 5 h and its sensitivity to proteasomal degradation was minimal (fig. 1e, f). collectively, these results indicate that hiv-1 in, when expressed inside the cells, is subject to relatively rapid proteasome-mediated degradation.fig. 1degradation of retroviral integrases by the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. a schematic representation of the hiv-1 in stability assay. hela cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing flag-tagged in or

the established interacting partners of hiv-1 in might affect its levels. we found that sirnas against ledgf/p75, ku70, pin1, and the combination of jnk1 and jnk2 significantly reduced the amount of in (fig. 1g–i for experimental scheme, representative immunoblot, and quantification, respectively). we also knocked down the vbp1 protein, which was reported to tether in to the von hippel lindau (vhl)/cullin 2 (cul2) ubiquitin degradation complex, and vhl and cul2 themselves; in none of these cases, however, in levels were increased. for all these knock-downs, immunoblotting analysis revealed >65% downregulation of the respective sirna targets (supplementary fig. 1). none of the sirnas had an effect on the levels of the egfp protein expressed in the same cells in a separate experiment (fig. 1h).collectively, these results indicate that the host ubiquitin-proteasome system targets hiv-1 in for degradation through a still unrecognized ubiquitin ligase. they also show that a few cellular factors protect in from degradation.high throughput screening for cellular factors responsible for hiv-1 in levelsto identify host factors responsible for in degradation, we performed a high-content, fluorescence microscopy-based, high throughput screening (hts) using a library of sirnas against factors in the ubiquitin-conjugation system, including e1 and e2 enzymes and e3 ring and hect domain ligases (598 target genes, 4 sirnas per target, pooled). hela cells were reverse-transfected in 96-well plates with each sirna pool (efficiency of transfection >85%), in duplicate, and 24 h later were transfected with egfp-in. after further 48 h, the cells were fixed, nuclei were counterstained with hoechst 33342 and gfp fluorescence was analyzed by high-content microscopy (workflow shown in fig. 2a; 2500 cells in the duplicates were analyzed per experimental condition). the egfp-moiety did not interfere with in degradation, since the fusion protein responded to proteasome inhibition in a dose-responsive manner similar to the wild-type in (supplementary fig. 2a, b). in cells expressing the protein and treated with chx and mg132, the levels of egfp-in progressively decreased over time, with an estimated half-life of ~60 min (supplementary fig. 2c, d, similar to flag-tagged in. cell viability in the screening was assessed by counting nuclei number; after assessing normal distribution (shapiro-wilk test), sirnas exerting a toxic effect zscore p ≤ 0.10) were excluded from further analysis.fig. 2high-throughput, sirna-based screening to identify cellular

screening were conducted; the replicates showed good reproducibility (spearman r = 0.74; fig. 2b). results of the two screening for the 557 sirnas not impairing cell viability, expressed as log10-fold over mock control, are reported in supplementary table 1. cell treatment with mg132 and with a non-targeting (nt) sirna (both performed in quadruplicate) served as internal controls.these replicate screenings identified 35 sirnas that increased the percentage of egfp fluorescent cells more than twofold than control. we focused our attention on the 6 genes the knock-down of which was among the top 10 most effective in both screenings (in red in fig. 2b and supplementary table 1) and on the 4 additional genes the knock down of which was among the top 10 in one of screening while anyhow showing an effect ≥2 fold over control in the other screening (in green in fig. 2b and supplementary table 1).these included the e2 protein ube2j2 (ubc6), an er-associated e2 conjugating enzyme involved in the degradation of misfolded cellular proteins24,25 and nine e3 ubiquitin ligases. two of these were f-box proteins, which form functional complexes with skp1 and cul to generate multisubunit e3 ligases (scf)26: fbxo42 and fbxo28, the latter known to be an important regulator of cell cycle progression27,28. other e3 ligases were rfpl3, shown to increase hiv-1 integration by modulating the activity of the hiv-1 pics29; rnf31 (also known as hoip), a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (lubac), an e3 ligase that generates linear poly-ubiquitin chains30; dtx2, a member of deltex protein family, acting as a positive regulator of notch signaling31,32; nhlrc1/malin, essential for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of laforin33, mutations of which lead to lafora disease34,35; rnf125 (also known as trac-1, which positively regulates t-cell activation36 - this protein is known to downregulate hiv-1replication at the transcriptional level in a ubiquitin–proteasome dependent manner37 and is a component of the innate immune response38–; and, finally, two members of the trim family, which harbors antiviral activities against rna and dna viruses39,40, trim72 (also known as mitsugumin-53, mg53), a skeletal and cardiac tissue-specific protein involved in the plasma membrane repair41 and trim33, alias tif1γ/rfg7/ptc7/ectodermin, which belongs to the transcriptional intermediary factor1 (tif1) subfamily of trim proteins42 and has variously been implicated in tumorigenesis43.we wanted to ensure specificity of the hts results for these top 10 hits. first, we tested the effects of each of the sirna pools by immunoblotting lysates of sirna-treated cells with antibodies against the respective proteins. the levels of 6 of the investigated proteins (trim33, fbox28, rnf31, rnf125, rfpl3, and dtx2) were effectively decreased after sirna treatment (>85% decrease; fig. 2c), while none of the commercially available antibodies we could test were active against trim72, fbox42, nhlrc1, and ube2j2. second, we tested the top 10 sirna pools to ensure that they effectively upregulated the levels of in by immunobloting of cell lysates expressing in-flag. we found that four sirnas (against trim33, fbox28, dtx2, and ube2j2) increased in protein levels significantly; β-catenin, which is actively degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway44, served as an endogenous control in these experiments (representative blot in fig. 2d and quantification in fig. 2e). the effect of these four sirna pools in cells expressing egfp-in is shown in fig. 2f. those against trim33, fbox28, and dtx2 were specific for in, since they did not affect the levels of egfp alone transfected together with in (separate experiment at the bottom fig. 2d). of interest, treatment with the same sirna pools also upregulated in levels in cells in which pin1 had been downregulated, thus determining in instability15 (supplementary fig. 2e, f for a representative immunoblot and quantification, respectively). in particular, the knock-down of trim33 in pin1-depleted cells restored in at levels comparable to those determined by mg132, consistent with the conclusion  that in instability induced by pin1 knockdown is mediated by trim33-mediated in degradation. third, we deconvoluted the four sirna pools against trim33, fbox28, dtx2, and ube2j2 by individually testing the effect, on the respective protein level and on in stability, of the four individual sirnas composing each of these pools. three out of four sirnas against trim33 decreased the levels of this protein and, at the same time, increased those of in (supplementary fig. 2g). in the cases of the fbox28, dtx2, and ube2j2 sirnas, instead, there was inconsistency between the extent of the respective protein knock-down and the increase in in levels (supplementary fig. 2h–j). considering these findings, and after having observed the marked increase in in levels after trim33 knock-down, we decided to concentrate our attention on this protein in the subsequent experiments.trim33 is the only tif1 family member that regulates hiv-1 integrase stabilitythe tif1 subfamily of trim proteins contains four members: trim24, trim28, trim33, and trim66. the first three tif1 proteins are highly conserved in domain organization and amino acid sequence (fig. 3a) and were shown to form complexes in hepatocellular carcinoma cells45,46. therefore, we asked whether other trim33 family members also affected in stability. we silenced trim24 and trim28 using both sirna pools and individual sirnas against the two proteins – obtained after pool deconvolution –, in cells expressing hiv-1 in. in neither case we observed increased in levels despite effective protein knock-down; cell treatment with mg132 served as a control for these experiments (fig. 3b, c for trim24 and trim28, respectively). an increase in in levels was only observed in cells transfected with sirna #23 against trim24, which we attribute to an off-target, unspecific effect. in these experiments, we also checked whether the specific knockdown of trim24 or trim28 affected the reciprocal protein levels, as well the levels of trim33. in no case the individual protein knock-down altered the amounts of the other tif1 members. similarly, knock-down of trim33 had no effect on the levels of either trim24 or trim28, while it markedly increased in amount, thus confirming the previous findings (fig. 3d). we conclude that trim33 is the only tif1 protein regulating hiv-1 in levels.fig.

one-way anovafull size imagenext we assessed whether trim33 silencing stabilized hiv-1 in after blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide. in these experiments, we transiently knocked-down trim33, pin1, or ledgf/p75 24 h before cell transfection with flag-in. after additional 48 h, we treated cells with cycloheximide for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min in stability was examined by immunoblotting with anti-flag antibody. in trim33-depleted cells, the basal levels of in were increased and its rate of disappearance markedly slowed down, indicative of protein stabilization (~75% of protein still present after 90 min of chx treatment vs. <20% in control cells; fig. 3e for representative blots and fig. 3f for quantification). depletion of ledgf/p75 showed an opposite effect, albeit more modest, consistent with the protective function of this factors on in degradation. the results of these experiments indicate that trim33 is a major determinant of in stability.next we wondered whether trim33 was capable to also modulate the stability of mlv in or exclusively acted on the hiv-1 protein; in this set of experiments we also analyzed the effect of other hiv-in-stabilizing cellular factors (pin1, ledgf/p75, and ku70) on mlv in. cells were transfected with sirnas against the individual factors under investigation together with plasmids expressing either flag-tagged hiv-1 or mlv in proteins. forty-eight hours post transfection, total in levels were examined by immunoblotting with anti-flag antibody. hiv-1 in levels increased upon trim33 silencing and decreased upon silencing of the stabilizing factors (fig. 3g top panel for a representative immunoblot and fig. 3h for quantification). in the case of mlv in, neither knock-down of trim33 increased nor silencing of ledgf/p75 or ku70 decreased protein level, while pin1 knock-down even augmented it (fig. 3g bottom panel and fig. 3h).the hiv-1 in protein, which normally carries an n-terminal phenylalanine, is a target of the proteasome-dependent n-rule protein degradation pathway3. to assess whether trim33 might be involved in this process, we expressed untagged in by transfecting hela cells with bicistronic plasmids co-expressing egfp and various in variants carrying different n-terminal amino acids3 (supplementary fig. 3a). as expected, the levels of variants carrying phenylanine or histidine as the first amino acid were markedly reduced by proteasomal degradation, as evidenced by the capacity of mg132 to rescue this phenotype (supplementary fig. 3b). depletion of trim33 increased the levels of all variants, but did not revert the effect of the n-terminal rule pathway on the phenylanine and histidine-carrying in proteins. these results indicate that trim33 affects in stability with a mechanism that is additional to that of the n-terminal rule, also consistent with binding of trim to a portion of in different from the n-terminal domain (cf. later).trim33 e3 ligase marks in for degradation via poly-ubiquitinationtrim33 belongs to the ring type ubiquitin e3 ligase family, the members of which ubiquitinate substrate proteins by directly binding17,47. the protein has a predominately nuclear localization, both soluble and chromatin-bound, however a significant portion of it was is detected in the cytoplasm (supplementary fig. 4). recent information indicates that cytoplasmic trim33 is also present in cd4+ t lymphocytes48; here, the protein can interact with incoming hiv-1 in. thus, we wanted to further explore the interaction between trim33 and in by co-immunoprecipitation studies. a flag-in expressing plasmid, or control plasmids expressing flag-luciferase or werner helicase interacting protein1 (whip1) were transfected into hek293t cells. whip1 contains a zinc-finger domain and is found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. similar to trim33, whip1 also binds chromatin49,50. the flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag m2 magnetic beads and the amount of endogenous trim33 in the precipitated immunocomplexes was examined by western blotting with an anti-trim33 antibody (fig. 4a). we found that endogenous trim33 bound in; both transfected proteins and endogenous trim33 were well expressed inside the cells.fig. 4cellular trim33 binds hiv-1 integrase and regulates its degradation by poly-ubiquitination. a endogenous trim33 interacts with hiv-1 in in

protein (ubi-in) in whole cell extracts, normalized over total in. experiments were performed as in panel efull size imageto map the domain of in that mediates binding to trim33, we performed pull-down assays using gst-tagged proteins corresponding to full-length in or segments of the protein corresponding to its n-terminal domain (ntd), catalytic core domain (ccd) and c-terminal domain (ctd); gst alone served as a negative control (fig. 4b). binding of these proteins to in vitro translated, [35s]-labeled trim33 revealed binding to full length in and to the in ctd domain (>8.5% binding; p < 0.01 in both cases), but not to the other domains of the protein (<3% binding; fig. 4c). all the gst fusion proteins were expressed and purified at comparable levels for the gst-pull down binding assays (coomassie blue-stained gel at the bottom of fig. 4c).next we examined in ubiquitination in hek293t cells transfected with flag-tagged in together with a plasmid expressing ha-tagged ubiquitin, followed by analysis of the in ubiquitination profile in samples immunoprecipitated with flag m2 beads. we found that ubiquitin molecules are mainly linked to in through lysine 48 (k48), rather than k63, consistent with the notion that k48-polyubiquitinated in is further recognized by the cellular ubiquitin/proteasome system for protein degradation (fig. 4d). these results were further validated by co-expressing various ha-tagged ubiquitin mutants (k48, k48r, and ko/no lysine) together with flag-tagged in in hek293t cells, followed by in immunoprecipitation and visualization of its modification using ha and anti-k48 antibodies. here again we found increased levels of ubiquitinated in in cells overexpressing k48-ubiquitin compared to those transfected with a k48r or ko-no lysine ubiquitin mutants (supplementary fig. 5a). these results are all consistent with the conclusion  that k48-linked polyubiquitination mainly leads to hiv-1 in degradation.next, we examined polyubiquitination of in in trim33-depleted cells, as well as in ku70-depleted cells, in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. we found that the knockdown of trim33 reduced in polyubiquitination (fig. 4e, f). of note, in these experiments the knockdown of trim33 also determined a significant accumulation of non-polyubiquitinated protein, in line with its stabilizing effect on the protein.we also assessed the involvement of different e2 conjugating enzymes in in poly-ubiquitination. these experiments were performed using purified recombinant flag-tagged trim33 (obtained in mammalian cells; supplementary fig. 5b) and recombinant gst-in (obtained in e. coli, supplementary fig. 5c), using an e2 scan kit analyzing the effect of 34 different e2 ligases. we found that multiple e2s are capable of trim33-dependent in ubiquitination, including 2e1, 2e2, 2e3, 2f, 2g1, 2h, and 2q (supplementary fig. 5d).mapping the trim determinants involved in in regulationto identify which trim33 domain is important for its interaction with in, we co-expressed egfp-tagged in together with various flag-tagged trim33 variants carrying deletions in the phd/bromodomain, rbcc/trim domain or both (δphd/bromo, δtrim and linker respectively; supplementary fig. 6a). after recovery of the trim33 proteins using anti-flag m2 magnetic beads, we tested the immunoprecipitates for the presence of in. we found that in bound to wild-type trim33 and the δphd/bromo deletant, but not to the other mutants (supplementary fig. 6b). all the proteins were equally expressed in the cells. we conclude that integrity of the rbcc/trim domain at the n-terminus of trim33 is essential for its interaction with in.trim33 harbors two catalytically active domains, ring and phd, which can post-translationally modify the target proteins by conjugating them with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules16,17,51. to understand which of these two domains is responsible for in ubiquitin-mediated degradation, we co-expressed egfp-in and ha-ubiquitin with flag-tagged wild-type trim33 or two catalytically inactive mutants bearing amino acid substitution in either of these domains, namely ring(c125a/c128a) and phd(c901a/c902a/c905a); fig. 5a. forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with mg132 for 5 h. then in was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-gfp antibody and the ubiquitinated forms of the proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with an anti-ha antibody (fig. 5b for a representative immunoblot and fig. 5c for quantification). wild-type trim33 increased in poly-ubiquitination, an effect that was abolished by the ring domain point mutations; mutations in the phd domain, instead, had no apparent effect. both trim33 mutants, however, were equally effective as the wild-type protein in binding to in in gst pull-down assays (supplementary fig. 6c).fig. 5mapping the trim determinants determining integrase stability. a schematic representation of the trim33 protein and its

transfected with combinations of plasmids expressing ha-ubiquitin, egfp-in, flag-trim33 and its catalytically inactive mutants (ring and phd), and pcdna3 as an empty vector. cells were harvested after

cells stably transfected to express an shrna against trim33 (trim33 kd), the wild-type trim33 protein or the catalytically inactive ring(ca) mutant. analysis of protein levels was performed at different times after treatment with cycloheximide. we found that stable depletion of trim33 stabilized in, consistent with our previous findings, while overexpression of the wild-type protein cdna, but not that of its ring mutant, accelerated its degradation (representative blot and quantification in fig. 5d, e respectively). treatment with the mg132 proteasome inhibitor rescued the effect of wild-type trim33 overexpression on in levels. no effect of any of the treatments was observed on simultaneously transfected egfp protein, remarking the specificity of the findings for in.taken together, these results corroborate the conclusion  that trim33 is a novel hiv-1 in e3 ligase that binds the in carboxy-terminal domain and determines its poly-ubiquitination, pending integrity of its ring domain.trim33 inhibits hiv-1 infection at the viral dna integration stepwe wanted to understand the role of trim33 in hiv-1 infection. first, we assessed efficiency of single-round infection of hela cells that had been depleted of trim33, with a vsv-g-pseudotyped hiv-1 vector carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the hiv-1 ltr (clone nl4-3.luc.r-e-; supplementary fig. 7a). forty-eight hours after infection of cells in which trim33 had been silenced, luciferase activity (supplementary fig. 7b) and, more markedly, the levels of integrated hiv-1 dna (supplementary fig 7c) were elevated, while those of 2ltr circles markedly reduced (supplementary fig. 7d). in contrast, downregulation of either pin1 or ledgf/p75 decreased both the amount of integrated provirus and luciferase activity, while 2ltr formation increased only in ledgf/p75-depleted cells. in trim33-knock down cells, both early and late hiv reverse transcripts were also slightly increased (supplementary fig. 7e, f respectively), likely because of the effect of in on the efficiency of reverse transcription52. we verified that the downregulation of the investigated proteins by sirnas in these experiments was effective (>90% decrease; representative experiment in supplementary fig. 7g).supported by these findings, we wanted to assess the effect of permanent trim33 knockdown on wild-type hiv-1 infection in t cells (experimental scheme in fig. 6a). for this purpose, we generated five vsv-g-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, each one expressing a different shrna targeting trim33 (shrnas #4, #5, #6, #7 and #8) and carrying a puromycin-resistance gene to selected transduced supt1 cell clones. vectors carrying shrnas #4 and #5 were highly effective in downregulating the protein (representative blot in fig. 6b; >80% of protein reduction). a lentiviral vector carrying a control shrna, submitted to the same procedure, served as a control in these experiments.fig. 6trim33

plasmids for the two in proteins were transfected into hela cells in which trim33 was knocked down by rnai; cells were then treated with cycloheximide 30 µg/ml for the indicated time points prior to lysis. the panel shows a representative immunoblots using antibodies against in, trim33 and tubulin as a loading control. f quantification of in levels in the presence of cycloheximide for the indicated time points in the whole cell extracts of supt1 cells treated with sirnas against trim33 or not targeting and transfected with either wt in or in(s57a). after normalization for tubulin, data (mean ± sem; n = 3 independent experiments) are expressed as a percentage of time = 0 for each treatmentfull size imagenext, we transduced supt1 t cells expressing shrna #4 or shrna #5 against trim33 and, after 6 day-puromycin selection, we infected these cells with wt hiv-1bru; infection was monitored over a course of 12 days by measuring the amounts p24 viral protein in the cell culture supernatant. infection was markedly increased in cells in which trim33 was knocked down (shown for anti-trim shrna #4 in fig. 6c). the negative effect of trim33 was also confirmed in single-round hiv-1nl4-3.luc.r-e- infection of the shrna-transduced cells, in which luciferase activity was selectively increased in clones #4 and #5 in which the proteins had been knocked down (experimental scheme and results of luciferase acitivity in supplementary fig. 7h, i respectively). on the contrary, overexpression of the trim33 cdna significantly decreased infection with this molecular clone (supplementary fig. 7i, j for luciferase activity and levels of trim33 in the transfected cells, respectively).our previous work had shown that an hiv-1 virus carrying the in(s57a) point mutation, which severely hampers in stability, is markedly less infectious15. thus, we wondered whether the knock-down of trim33 might revert infectivity of this molecular clone. by analyzing t-cell infection with hiv-1bruin(s57a), we indeed confirmed that this clone is markedly less infectious than wt hiv-1bru in control cells, however we observed that its infectivity was completely rescued by the trim33 knock-down (shown for supt1 cells carrying anti-trim33 shrna #4 in fig. 6c; again, superimposable results were obtained for shrna #5). impairment of hiv-1bruin(s57a) infection and rescue by trim33 downregulation was also observed by analyzing the levels of integrated dna by alu-ltr at day 3 after infection (fig. 6d). in these experiments, trim33 known down resulted in similar levels of hiv-1 integrated dna in cells infected with wt virus or the mutated in clone.we found that mutant in(s57a) bound to trim33 equally well as the wild-type protein in immunoprecipitation assays (supplementary fig. 7l; however poly-ubiquitination of this protein was significantly enhanced (representative ubiquitin blot in supplementary fig. 7m and quantification in supplementary fig. 7n), consistent with increased protein degradation. transient depletion of trim33 by rnai resulted in markedly increased stability of the in(s57a) mutant (estimated half-life: <45 min and >90 min in the absence and presence of trim33 knockdown, respectively; fig. 6e, f for representative images and quantification, respectively).collectively, these results indicate that depletion of trim33 markedly augments hiv-1 infection by increasing integration of the viral genome into the host cell dna and is sufficient to revert the phenotype of hiv-1bruin (s57a) by increasing stability of the mutant in protein.we wanted to assess the role of trim33 in regulating degradation of in carried by hiv-1 during infection. we thus infected trim33 kd cells, which stably express an anti-trim33 shrna, with hiv-1 (25 μg of p24 per million of cells), followed by analysis of in levels by immunoblotting for the subsequent 5 h (experimental scheme in fig. 7a). incoming hiv-1 in degradation in the early hours after infection was markedly reduced in cells expressing the trim33 shrna (fig. 7b). in similar experimental conditions, we also investigated binding between endogenous trim33 and virion-associated in in control infected cells. after 4 hour hiv-1 infection in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, interaction between in and trim was assessed by immunoprecipitation in whole cell lysates. we found that both trim33 and in co-immunoprecipitated with the respective partners during viral infection (fig. 7c).fig. 7interaction of trim33 with integrase from infectious hiv-1. a analysis of in protein levels in trim33-knockdown (trim33 kd) cells during hiv-1 infection. cells stably expressing an anti-trim33 shrna were infected for 1 h with hiv-1; at the indicated time points after infection, cells were washed with pbs and the levels of in were analyzed. b western blot showing in levels in control and trim33 depleted cells beta-actin was used as a loading control; trim33 downregulation was verified using an anti-trim33 antibody. c trim33 interacts with in during hiv-1 infection. supt1 cells were infected with hiv-1 in the presence of mg132. either trim33 or in were immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies, followed by immunoblotting to test the presence of the reciprocal protein. d analysis of the effect of stable knockdown and overexpression of trim33 variants in multiple round infection with wild-type hiv-1. supt1 cells stably expressing an hrna targeting the trim33 3′-utr (selected after transduction with a lentiviral vector and selection for puromycin) were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing the trim33 coding sequence (cs) or the coding sequence of the ring(ca) mutant. after selection with hygromycin, cells were infected with wild type hiv-1bru, followed by analysis of infection over time by p24 elisa. e western blotting analysis showing trim33 levels after transduction with shrna targeting 3′-utr of trim33 alone or after transduction of wild-type or mutant trim33 (trimm33cs or ring(ca)cs. tubulin was used as a loading control. f real-time rt-pcr analysis showing trim33 expression after transduction with the shrna targeting the 3′-utr of trim33 alone or after transduction of wild type or mutant trim33. g stable knockdown of trim33 enhances wild-type hiv-1 replication, while overexpression of its catalytically active cdna reduces it. the graph shows the levels of p24 in control sup1 cells or cells previously transduced with anti-trim33 shrna targeting the 3′-utr of the protein, with or without transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing the coding sequence of wild type trim33 (trim33cs) or that of the catalytically inactive ring(ca) mutant (ring(ca)cs), after infection with wild-type virus. the results are representative of three independent experimentsfull size imagefinally, we also wanted to examine viral replication in cells in which endogenous trim33 was stably knocked down and then restored through expression of its either its wild type or mutant cdna. for this purpose, we generated a lentiviral vector expressing an shrna targeting the 3′utr of endogenous trim33 (shtrim33(3’utr)) and used this vector to generate a stable supt1 t cell line by selection for puromycin. this line was then transduced with one of either two additional lentiviral vectors, carrying the resistance gene for hygromycin, expressing the coding sequences for either wild type trim33 or its catalytically inactive ring mutant (trim33cs and ring(ca)cs respectively); both these cdnas were devoid of the 3′ utr and thus insensitive to the shrna (scheme in fig. 7d). after 7 days double antibiotic selection, we verified proper expression of the trim proteins in the different clones (representative western blot and rt-pcr quantification in fig. 7e, f and respectively) and then infected these cells with wt hiv-1bru; infection was monitored over a course of 12 days by measuring the amounts p24 viral protein production. infection was significantly increased in cells which stably expressed the anti-trim33 shrna. overexpression of the trim33cs decreased hiv-1 infection while this effect was blunted by expression of its catalytically inactive mutant (fig. 7g).taken together, these results are consistent in showing that cellular trim33 binds in from infectious hiv-1 and regulates viral replication by promoting its degradation.discussion high throughput screening of a human sirna library targeting all known components of the ubiquitin conjugation system has revealed that the trim33 ring finger e3 ligase is responsible for hiv-1 in degradation and thus acts an inhibitory factor for hiv-1 infection by preventing viral dna integration. thus, trim33 adds to the group of cellular proteins that counteract different steps of the virus life cycle, including capsid disassembly (rhesus trim5 proteins), prevention of reverse transcription (samhd-1), viral cdna nuclear import (mxb), release of nascent viral particles (tetherin/bst-2), viral rna deamination (members of the apobec3 (a3) family; reviewed in ref. 53,54) and virion infectivity (serinc3 and serinc555,56). consistent with an inhibitory role at the pre-integration step, overexpression of trim33 decreased the levels of integrated viral dna while its knock-down had an opposite effect. in addition, absence of trim33 rescued infectivity of an hiv-1 molecular clone carrying a substitution of serine 57 to alanine, a mutation that destabilizes integrase activity while leaving earlier steps in the virus life cycle unaffected, including uncoating and reverse transcription15.in our screening for sirnas that rescued hiv-1 in degradation, trim33 was the only factor (i) that scored in the top 10 positions in the duplicate screenings, (ii) that was the most effective in increasing in levels when knocked down using an sirna pool and (iii) for which three individual sirnas out of four reproduced the phenotype of the sirna pool after deconvolution. three other sirna pools (against fbox28, dtx2, and ube2j2) also increased in levels significantly, but deconvolution revealed that either the individual sirnas composing the pools were not active against their respective targets or that their effect did not increase in levels. ube2j2 also scored negative in the e2 scan kit in which we analyzed the effect of all e2 enzymes.in the cases of fbxo42, nhlrc1/malin, and trim72 we could not assess the levels of individual protein silencing since none of the available antibodies were effective; however, the sirna pools against these proteins did not increase in levels by western blotting. no effect on in was also the case for the rnf31, rnf125/trac1, and rfpl3 sirnas. as far as the last of these three factors is concerned, published evidence indicates that rfpl3 stimulates hiv-1 pic integration activity in an in vitro integration assay29, thus acting in an opposite manner as predicted for a destabilizing, in-specific e3 ligase.past work using a yeast two hybrid system has shown that in can bind the von hippel–lindau binding protein 1 (vbp1), a subunit of the prefolding chaperone, which bridges interaction between in and the cullin2 (cul2)-based von hippel–lindau (vhl) ubiquitin ligase57. in our assay conditions for in stability, however, sirnas against all components of the complex (vbp1, vhl, and cul2) were ineffective in increasing in levels, while vhl scored neutral in our original screening with all e3 ligases. downregulation of vbp1 or vhl, however, has been reported to markedly decrease, and not increase, hiv-1 replication, since this interaction would be expected to occur at a step when viral cdna integration has already occurred and to be necessary for efficient transcription of viral genes57. thus vhl, in any case, would not qualify as the e3 ligase primarily responsible for in stability and thus efficiency of viral cdna integration, as instead is the case for trim33.trim33 (tif1γ) belongs to the trim (tripartite motif) family of proteins, which display potent antiviral activity against several viruses39. the protein was originally discovered as its cdna, under low stringency conditions, cross-hybridized with a probe corresponding to a portion trim24 (tif1α), the founding member of the tif1 family42. in mice and humans, trim33 acts as a tumor suppressor in different tissues, including hematopoietic compartment58, liver59 and pancreas60, and as a major regulator of tgfβ signaling in development. in particular, trim33 interacts with tgfβ receptor-activated, phosphorylated smad2/3 and competes with formation of a heterodimer with smad4, an essential step in tgfβ signaling61. additionally, trim33 also mediates ubiquitination of smad4 attenuating the transcriptional response to tgfβ signaling, thus favoring ectoderm specification62,63. trim33 was also shown to be recruited at sites of dna damage in a parp1- and alc1- dependent manner64 and to regulate cell cycle progression65,66. at the chromatin level, trim33 behaves as a transcriptional co-suppressor49,67.our work indicates that trim33 suppresses hiv-1 infection by promoting ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of in, thus preventing proviral formation. trim33 has mainly nuclear localization, but a portion of it can also be found in the cytosol. thus, we speculate that it might encounter the incoming in in both compartments, prior to proviral formation. hiv-1 is not a unique target for trim33 antiviral function, since the protein also limits adenoviral infection by blocking early and late gene expression, an activity that is counteracted by the viral e4-orf3 protein68,69.studies using recombinant proteins have shown that the coiled-coil region of trim33 mediates heterodimerization of the protein with trim2470; in addition, in mouse hepatocytes, these two proteins are also found in complex with the third member of the tif1 family, trim2859. of interest, our own past work has revealed that trim28/kap1 selectively binds in post-translationally modified by acetylation and that, in complex with hdac1, curtails viral infection by promoting in deacetylation71. given these observations and considering the high similarity in domain organization and sequence among the three tif1 members, we wondered whether trim24 or trim28 might also affect in stability. we found, however, that trim33 was the only one of the three proteins to be effective. in addition, no effect of trim33 knock-down on the levels of either of the two other members was detected.trim33 belongs to ring-type e3 ligases, which bind both their target proteins and ubiquitin-loaded e2-conjugating enzyme and catalyze transfer of ubiquitin to the target17,47. indeed, we found that in and trim33 interacted directly in vitro by pull-down assays and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation; integrity of the c-terminal domain of in and the ring domain of trim33 were essential for this interaction to occur. consistent with this information, deletion and point mutations in the trim33 ring domain both impeded binding and blocked in ubiquitination respectively; mutations in the phd domain were ineffective. thus, hiv-1 in adds to the list of cellular proteins the stability of which is regulated by the e3 ubiquitin ligase activity of trim33, capable to induce both ubiquitination (for smad462 and ldb172) and sumoylation (for snon173).in addition to their substrates, ring-type e3 ligases also directly bind their cognate e2 conjugating enzymes. approximately 35 of these e2 enzymes are predicted to exist, all of which contain a catalytic (ubc) domain with an active site cysteine residue74. known members of the trim family specifically interact with the d and e subclasses of e2 conjugating enzymes, except trim9, which interacts with ube2g2 and trim32 with ube2v1/v275. by scanning the effect of 34 purified e2 enzymes in the presence of trim33 we found that multiple e2s were able to assist this e3 ligase in the poly-ubiquitination of in. this redundancy well explains why no specific e2 enzymes were detected in our primary sirna screening for in stability.the effect of trim33 in determining in poly-ubiquitination and degradation was specific for the hiv-1 enzyme. in contrast, the moloney mlv in was long-lived, relatively insensitive to even high doses of proteasome inhibitor and unaffected by trim33 downregulation. in addition, sensitivity of hiv-1 in to trim33-mediated proteasomal degradation was increased by silencing of ledgf/p75, ku70, and pin1, while no protective effect of these factors was detected for mlv in. ledgf/p75 is a selective partner of hiv-in5,12,13, while ku70 was shown to bind both hiv-1 in14 and mlv in76. for both factors, binding to hiv-1 in was also shown to prevent its proteasomal degradation7,14. thus, we can speculate that the protective effect of these factors on hiv-1 in stability is exerted by masking binding to trim33, a conclusion  that can be tested experimentally using recombinant factors.in the case of pin1, this enzyme isomerizes phosphorylated hiv-1 in and this conformational change increases in stability15. again, it can be postulated that cis-trans isomerization of hiv-1 in alters trim33 recognition. finally, of additional potential interest for future research, our experiments also reveal that knock-down of pin1 increased mlv in, opposite of hiv-1 in, possibly hinting to a still undefined role of this isomerase on mlv stability.the molecular effects exerted by trim33 on the stability of hiv-1 in have significant impact on the infectivity of hiv-1 virions. overexpression of the protein curtails hiv-1 infection, while its silencing enhances it, as proven by both single-round infections or standard infections with wild type virus. of note, our results show that trim33 knock-down reverts the phenotype of an hiv-1 virus carrying the in(s57a) point mutation, which our past work had shown to be less infectious because its in is more prone to proteasomal degradation15. this finding represents a further indication of the relevance of the trim33 e3 ligase in the hiv-1 life cycle.finally, we have previously reported that hiv-1 integrates its dna in euchromatic regions in correspondence to the nuclear periphery and have suggested that this peculiar localization might be the inevitable consequence of the relatively short life of viral in, which would prevent effective inward diffusion of the virus77. based on the results shown here, we predict that trim33 knock down would allow the virus to also reach inner compartments in the nuclear interior, a hypothesis that will be tested in future experiments.methodscells and antibodieshela (atcc,

cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. screening was performed in duplicate. the screening was performed at the icgeb high-throughput screening facility (http://www.icgeb.org/high-throughput-screening.html).image acquisition and analysisimage acquisition was performed using an imagexpress micro automated high-content screening fluorescence microscope (molecular devices) at a ×10 magnification; a total of 16 images were acquired per wavelength, well and replicate (~10,000–15,000 cells per well and replicate). image analysis was performed using the ‘multi-wavelength cell scoring’ application module implemented in metaxpress software (molecular devices). briefly, nuclei were segmented based on hoechst 33342 staining, and cells were then classified as positive or negative depending on the total area of gfp-in staining.immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescencefor immunoprecipitation, cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50m tris hcl ph 7.5,150 mm nacl, 1 mmedta, 0.5% np40) containing protease inhibitors (roche). protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the bradford assay (biorad). anti-flag m2 agarose beads (sigma) and anti-gfp antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °c with cell extracts (0.5–1 mg). following incubation, protein-a agarose beads (santa cruz) were used to bind the immunocomplexes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. after incubation, beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer, and then processed for sds-page and immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. for co-immunoprecipitation from hiv-1 infected cells, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (35 mm tris hcl ph 7.5, 175 mm nacl, 0.5 mm dtt, 1.25 mm mgcl2, and 0.05% np-40) containing protease inhibitors. trim33 and in antibodies were conjugated with dynabeads™ protein g (invitrogen) and 3 mg of total protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitation according to the manufacturer’s instructions.in vivo ubiquitination assayfor in vivo ubiquitination, hek293t cells were co-transfected with egfp-in, wild type trim33 and its mutants and ha-tagged ubiquitin plasmids by standard calcium phosphate method. after 30 h, cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor mg132 before harvesting. whole cell extracts were prepared in ripa buffer - 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, 0.5% np40, protease inhibitor cocktail (roche) - and 1.5 mg protein was immunoprecipitated with specific antibody. after immunoprecipitation, the samples were extensively washed and resolved by sds-page and analyzed by western blotting using appropriate antibodies.cellular fractionationhela cells were transfected with a flag-in expressing plasmid (2 µg/well) in 6-well plates. after 48 h, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor for 4 h. cells were then washed with 1xpbs, trypsinized, collected into tubes and washed with cold pbs. cellular fractionation was performed using a subcellular protein fractionation kit as described by the manufacturer (thermo fisher). fractionated samples were separated by sds-page and electro blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. in and trim33 subcellular distribution and different sub cellular markers (tubulin and parp1) were monitored by immunoblotting using antibodies against in as anti-flag, anti-trim33, -tubulin, and -parp1.ubiquitin e2-conjugating enzyme screeningin vitro ubiquitin conjugation reactions were conducted in 20 μl containing ube1, one of 34 different recombinant e2 enzymes, 2 mm atp, 400 μm ubiquitin, purified recombinant trim33 e3 ligase and gst-in at 37 °c for 1 h, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ubiquigent e2scan kit, cambridge, usa). chip e3 ligase/ube2d4 were used as a positive control for the ubiquitination reaction, as it undergoes auto-ubiquitination. after 1 h, the reactions were stopped with sds-page sample buffer and resolved in 8% sds-page and analyzed by western blotting using anti-ubiquitin and anti-in antibodies.virus production and infectioninfectious viral stocks were produced by transfecting the plasmid expressing the viral genome into hek293t cells by standard calcium phosphate method and collecting supernatants after 48 h. the molecular clone for hiv-1bru corresponds to that of hiv-1lai. viral production was quantified in the supernatants for hiv-1 p24 antigen content using the innotest hiv antigen mab kit (innogenetics n.v. gent, belgium). before infection, the viral stock was treated with 40 u/ml dnase i (life sciences) for 1 h at 25 °c. hela/supt1/primary cd4+ t cells (1x106) were then infected with 1 μg of p24 for 4 h in the presence of polybrene (sigma). after infection, cells were kept in culture at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium supplemented with il-2. at days 3, 5, 7, and 10 post-infection, media and il-2 were replaced and cells were kept at a density of 1 × 106/ml. the env- molecular clone pnl4-3.luc.e-r-, a kind gift from nathaniel landau, harbors a frameshift mutation introduced near the 5′ end of envelope gene80 and performs a single-round infection once pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus–g (vsv-g) protein.lentiviral particles were produced in hek293t cells by transfecting 20 μg plasmid expressing shrna, 1 μg packaging vector (pcmvdelta8.91) and 5 μg pmd-vsg-g for pseudotyped envelope. lentiviral particles were collected after 48–72 h post transfection and titers were quantified in the supernatants as the amounts of hiv-1 p24 antigen using the innotest hiv antigen mab kit (innogenetics n.v. gent, belgium). lentiviral transduced cells were selected in puromycin-containing medium.integration assay (alu-ltr)hiv-1 integration was examined in infected cells by isolating genomic dna from 1×106 cells using the dneasy tissue kit (qiagen). alu-ltr sequences were amplified from 100–300 ng total genomic dna in a first round pcr using lm667 and alu1 primers, followed by a second round real-time pcr using one fifth of the first amplicon as a template together with the l-specific primer λt, the internal ltr primer lr and the probe zxf-p81. real-time pcr amplifications were performed on an abiprism 7000 machine, using the taqman technology (applied biosystem). results were normalized to the amount of extracted cellular dna of the single-copy lamin b2 gene, quantified by real-time pcr.luciferase assayfor the gene-silencing experiments, pin1, ledgf/p75, and trim33 depleted cells were infected with pseudotyped vsv-g pnl4.3.luc.e-r- hiv-1 virus. luciferase assays were performed after 48 h of infection with a luciferase assay kit (promega). to normalize luciferase activity, total protein concentrations were determined in whole cell extracts of infected cells with the bradford reagent (biorad), according to manufacturer’s protocol).in vitro binding assaysin vitro translated s35-trim33 was produced using tnt-sp6 rabbit reticulocyte lysate (promega) and pcs2-trim33 as a template. full length gst-in and its truncated variants (ntd, ccd, and ctd) purifications and in vitro binding were performed using standard procedures82. to remove contaminant bacterial nucleic acids, recombinant proteins were pretreated with nucleases (0.25 unit/µl dnase i and 0.2 µg/µl rnase) for 1 h at 25 °c in 50 mm tris hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm mgcl2, 2.5 mm cacl2, 100 mm nacl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dtt. subsequently, gst fusion proteins immobilized on agarose beads were washed and resuspended in netn buffer (20 mm tris hcl, ph7.5, 100 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 0.5% np-40, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride). in vitro binding between gst-in and gst-in truncated variants were performed by incubating 2 µg of recombinant with 400 cpm of in vitro translated trim33 in a netn buffer supplemented with 200 µg/ml ethidium bromide for 1 h at 4 °c on a rotating wheel, following five washes in netn buffer and once wash with 10 mm tris hcl ph 8.0/100 mm nacl. finally bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis in an sds 10% polyacrylamide gel, analyzed by phosphoimaging (cyclone) and stained with coomassie brilliant blue dye.rna extraction and real-time pcrtotal mrna was isolated from hela cells 72 h after sirna transfection using a standard trizol rna extraction protocol. the rna obtained (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using mlv-rt (invitrogen) with random hexameric primers (10 μm) in a 20-μl reaction following the manufacturer’s instructions. quantification of vbp1 and trim33 gene expressions was performed by quantitative real-rime pcr using the forward and reverse primers. expression of the housekeeping gene gapdh was used for normalization. amplifications were performed using a biorad cfx96 machine using gotaq qpcr master mix (promega). the real-time qpcr program was programmed with a melting curve dissociation protocol (from 60 °c to 95 °c), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.primers and probesthe following oligodeoxynucletide primers and probes were used in this study.alu15′-tcccagctactggggaggctgagg-3′lm6675′-atgccacgtaagcgaaactctggctaactagggaacccactg-3′lr5′-tccacactgactaaaagggtctga-3′λt5′-atgccacgtaagcgaaact-3′zxf-p

introduction access to safe, affordable and suitable forms of contraception is critical for young women in areas with high hiv-1 acquisition risk and aids prevalence. the majority of new hiv infections occur in women and in sub-saharan africa1,2. while many different types of contraception are available globally, the most common form in developing countries, where choice is limited, is the 3-monthly 150 mg intramuscular injection of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-provera or dmpa-im). norethisterone enanthate (nur-isterate or net-en), a 2-monthly 200 mg injection, is less widely used in developing countries. a 30% lower dose (104 mg), 3-monthly subcutaneous injectable contraceptive, dmpa-sc (sayana® press), with advantages of self-administration, is currently being widely introduced. an estimated 16.5 million women aged 15–49 used depo-provera or nur-isterate injectable contraceptives in sub-saharan africa in 2014, and these numbers are increasing annually3.worldwide analysis shows sub-saharan africa is the region with the highest use of dmpa-im injectable contraception and the highest hiv-1 prevalence4. of great concern is that meta-analyses of epidemiological data suggest a significant 1.4-fold increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition for dmpa-im users compared to no contraception, although the data may be confounded by behavioural factors5,6,7. no such association is shown for net-en compared to no contraception, although those studies are generally underpowered with large confidence intervals, while no information is available for dmpa-sc and hiv-1 acquisition risk5,6. furthermore, limited head-to-head studies suggest a significant 1.3 to 1.4-fold increase in hiv-1 acquisition risk for dmpa-im compared to net-en, although these studies have important limitations6,8. in 2017, the world health organization modified the medical eligibility criteria (mec) for contraceptive use of progestin-only contraceptive injectables, including dmpa-im, dmpa-sc and net-en, to mec2, and advised that these methods may increase risk of hiv acquisition9. to address these concerns with dmpa-im, a randomised clinical trial (echo trial: nct02550067) assessing hiv-1 acquisition in women using dmpa-im, relative to levonorgestrel (lng) implant and copper intrauterine devices (copper-iud) is currently ongoing. the trial involves 7800 women at several sites in sub-saharan africa in areas at high risk for hiv-1 acquisition, with results expected in 201910. however, this trial will not assess the relative or absolute risk of hiv-1 acquisition of dmpa-im, dmpa-sc or net-en. determination of the absolute and relative risk factors for hiv-1 acquisition and biological mechanisms for dmpa-im, dmpa-sc and net-en is a critical issue for women’s health, especially in developing countries11. disaggregation of these injectables is highly relevant for choice of contraceptive in these areas, especially given the widespread acceptability and contraceptive efficacy of injectables.clinical data suggest several plausible biological mechanisms whereby dmpa-im may increase hiv-1 acquisition in the female genital tract (fgt)12. these include increased frequency of ccr5+ t cells in the fgt mucosa13, increased expression levels of ccr5 on peripheral and fgt target t cells13,14, increased permeability of the fgt15 and alterations in levels of select secreted immunomodulators16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. many of these studies are consistent with data from animal models using dmpa doses resulting in similar mpa serum concentrations to those of human dmpa-im users15,25,26,27,28,29 as well as with several ex vivo studies30,31,32,33.we have previously shown that mpa and net have very different biological effects due to differences in their glucocorticoid-like properties. mpa binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (gr) with a relatively high affinity and acts like a full to partial gr agonist, depending on cellular context, while net exhibits almost no gr activity34,35. the concentration required for half maximal activity or ec50 for mpa regulation of gene expression via the gr in ex vivo cell models is in the range of about 1–100 nm and varies in a cell- and gene-specific manner32,36,37,38,39,40,41, while net shows no response via the gr32,36,37,38. this is well within the range of peak serum levels (cmax) of mpa in dmpa-im users. these vary widely between individuals and between studies from 3 to 100 nm12,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55, while plateau levels of about 2.6 nm are maintained for the rest of the 3 months44,46,50,51,52,56,57,58. when evaluated separately, the reported cmax values differ greatly between dmpa-sc and dmpa-im, with an average cmax value for dmpa-sc of about 3.3 nm59,60,61, while no significant differences have been detected in the mean serum trough levels from one head-to-head study62. however, whether a difference exists between dmpa-im and dmpa-sc cmax values11 remains to be determined, since these have not been evaluated in head-to-head studies. the cmax values reported for net-en of 10–50 nm12,46,54,63,64 are in a similar range to those reported for dmpa-im.based on the above, as well as the ubiquitous expression of the gr, unlike the progesterone receptor (pr) or androgen receptor (ar)34, mpa would be expected to exert widely different biological effects on multiple physiological processes via the gr, unlike net. we have recently shown that physiologically relevant concentrations of mpa, unlike net, increases hiv-1 infection ex vivo in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) via a gr-dependent mechanism65. we found that this involves, at least in part, increased expression of the ccr5 hiv-1 coreceptor on target t-lymphocytes65. mpa, unlike net, also increased activation of t-cells and increased the cd4/cd8 ratio ex vivo in pbmcs65. however, it is not known whether mpa or net have direct or different effects on hiv-1 pathogenesis in human genital tract tissue. in this study, we investigated our hypothesis that mpa will have different effects on hiv-1 replication in explant tissue compared to net due to its inherent different molecular properties and actions via the gr. we show for the first time that mpa, unlike equimolar net, dose-dependently increases replication of founder r5 hiv-1 virus and expression of ccr5 mrna, via the gr, at concentrations within the range of those found in the serum of dmpa-im and net-en users.methods and materialsethicspermission to perform these studies was granted by the human research ethics committee of the faculty of health sciences of the university of cape town (approval number: hrec 210/2011) and all procedures were approved and carried out

nl4-3 backbone known as nl–lucr.t2a–bal.ecto, was a kind gift from dr. christina ochsenbauer67, and known as hiv-1bal_renilla in this study.cell culturehuman embryonic kidney cells (hek293t) were purchased from america type culture collection (atcc, usa). human cervical tzm-bl cells, were procured from the nih aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih from dr. john c. kappes, dr. xiaoyun wu and tranzyme inc. (arp, nih, usa). cells were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks (greiner bio-one international, austria) in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium [(dmem) (sigma-aldrich, south africa) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate (sigma-aldrich, south africa), 44 mm sodium bicarbonate (sigma-aldrich, south africa), 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (thermo scientific, south africa) 100 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (p4333, sigma-aldrich, south africa); full dmem]. all cells were maintained at 37 °c in a water jacket incubator (90% humidity and 5% co2). cells were passaged twice a week with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin/ 0.1% (w/v) edta in pbs (highveld biological, south africa). trypsinisation was terminated with neutralisation medium (full dmem). all cells were routinely tested and found to be mycoplasma free.virus propagationinitial viral stocks were prepared as previously described68 with a few modifications. hek293t cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells/10 cm2 plate in full dmem supplemented with 25 mm hepes buffer (lonza, germany) at 37 °c in a water jacket incubator (90% humidity and 5% co2). the next day, media was replaced, and cells were transfected with 12 μg hiv-1pnl4.3, hiv-1bal-renilla or a control (dmem) using x-tremegene 9 dna transfection reagent (roche applied science, south africa) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. cells were incubated for 48 hr at 37 °c, the medium was passed through a 0.22 μm filter and charcoal-stripped (c-s) fcs (thermo scientific, usa) was added to a final concentration of 12.5%. the viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80 °c until use. virus titres were determined using the tzm-bl assay as previously described67. cells were harvested 72 hr later with 120 μl bright-glo luciferase lysis buffer (promega, usa). fluorescence was determined on a luminometer (modulus microplate, promega, usa), where relative light units were measured for each well. the titre of the virus stock was determined using the reed muench method and expressed as log infectious units (iu)/ml69.explant culture and infection experimentscervical tissue was obtained from hiv-1 negative, pre-menopausal women, not on contraception, with a normal pap smear and undergoing hysterectomies for benign reasons, after informed consent. fresh tissue was supplied from two sites in the western cape, south africa, namely groote schuur hospital and tygerberg hospital. inclusion criteria and donor consent were confirmed prior to the operation. blood samples were collected and sent to the national health laboratory services (nhls, groote schuur hospital, south africa) for serum antibody testing of hiv-1 and hsv 1/2 status. the majority of the samples were positive for hsv-1 and negative for hsv-2. additionally, serum levels of luteinising hormone (lh), follicle stimulating hormone (fsh), progesterone (p4) and estrogen (e2) were obtained from the majority of donors from blood samples and used to define the phase of the menstrual cycle, together with information on the clerking sheets. menstrual cycle was determined using the guidelines given by the nhls (south africa) (see supplementary table s1). supplementary table s2 summarizes donor information including hsv status, hormone levels, age, stage of menstrual cycle and reasons for surgery. when comparing matched conditions performed on the same donor, differences in donor hormone levels are unlikely to account for differences in results between conditions. we did not detect any statistically significant differences between endogenous hormone levels of donor samples used for non-matched incubations (see supplementary fig. s1). we routinely received more ectocervical tissue than endocervical tissue, so experiments on endocervical explants were more limited than for ectocervical explants.cervical tissue was processed as previously described70, between 1 to 3 hr post operation. excess underlying stromal tissue was removed from the epithelial layer of the ectocervical and endocervical tissue. the epithelial layer was then diced into 3 mm3 explant pieces, which were randomly placed into separate wells of 96 well round-bottomed plates. non-polarised explants were cultured in 200 μl rpmi (lonza, switzerland) supplemented with 10% (v/v) c-s fcs, 2 mm l-glutamine (sigma-aldrich, south africa), 10 μg/ml fungizone (sigma-aldrich, south africa), 10 u/ml il-2, 100 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (sigma-aldrich, south africa) and incubated at 37 °c in a water jacket incubator (90% humidity and 5% co2).explants were treated in triplicate or quadruplicate with vehicle control (0.1% [v/v] etoh) or ligands in parallel, at concentrations indicated in the figures, for 48 hr. researchers have reported using from 3 to 16 tissue blocks per condition71,72. our choice of block number was based on limited fresh tissue availability and a need to perform matched incubations for different conditions for each donor tissue. for infection, explants were exposed to either 10 000 iu/ml hiv-1bal-renilla or hiv-1pnl4.3 (in the presence of hormone) for 2 hr at 37 °c in a water jacket incubator. explants were then washed 4 x with 1 x pbs (containing 1% [v/v] cs-fcs) and transferred back to individual wells of a 96 well round-bottomed plate. explants were incubated in full media containing the appropriate concentration of ligand for a further 10 days post infection. half-media was exchanged at days 3, 5 and 7 post infection, and replaced with media containing 100 nm of the appropriate ligand for each treatment group for all explant experiments. media were harvested at days 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 post infection were aliquoted into flat-bottomed 96 well plates (griener, germany) and incubated with 5% (v/v) empigen® (b13 detergent, 45165, sigma-aldrich, south africa) in 1 x pbs for an hour at room temperature, to ensure viral inactivation. culture supernatants were spun at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and aliquoted into cryovials and stored at −80 °c. culture supernatants were subsequently assayed for hiv-1 p24gag release using a p24 elisa assay (innotest, innogenetics, belgium), as well as in some cases being used to measure soluble mediators or in add-back assays. p24 concentrations were calculated using the equation generated by the standard curve and p24 accumulation curves (pg/ml) was determined. experiments with an arv inhibitor showed that 3tc decreased the relative accumulated p24 levels, consistent with productive infection (see supplementary fig. s2). residual activity in the presence of 3tc could possibly be due to some inactivation of the arv due to metabolism in tissue73 or the passive release of hiv or p24 gag into tissue culture supernatant. some donor samples showed increased relative p24 accumulation continuously from day zero to day 10, while others did not exhibit an increase in p24 accumulation beyond day 5. donor samples that exhibited no increase in p24 accumulation after day 3, indicative of unsuccessful infection, were excluded from the analysis (about 20% of experiments). as infectivity varied between donors, pooled data was expressed as relative infection relative to vehicle control at day 3 post infection (etoh) set to 1. viability of tissue was assessed either by mtt at the time of processing, 48 hr pre-infection and at 10 days post-infection (data not shown) or the zombie cell viability stain 48 hr and 7 days after treatment. it is possible that the use of fresh tissue and the presence of il274 in our culture medium enhanced cell viability in our experiments.tzm-bl infection and add-back reporter assaytzm-bls were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 96-well flat-bottomed culture plate in full dmem. the following day the tzm-bls were either stimulated with hormone or maraviroc (mvc) for 24 hr in triplicate or supernatants from ectocervical explants, which were diluted 1:10 in dmem medium, as previously described75, with a few modifications. supernatants were harvested from ectocervical explants that had been stimulated with 100 nm of either mpa, net, mvc, or with vehicle controls in quadruplicate (0.1% [v/v] etoh or 0.1% [v/v] dmso). supernatants of treated ectocervical explants were pooled and subsequently centrifuged at 1200 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature to pellet cellular debris. as a control to compare the direct effects of mpa and net on hiv-1 replication, 100 nm mpa, net or a vehicle control (0.1% etoh) was incubated in full rpmi media in a 24 well culture dish for 48 hr. supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °c until use. after 24 hr incubation with either hormone or explant supernatant, cells were infected with 20 iu/ml hiv-1bal_renilla. cells were harvested 48 hr later with bright-glo luciferase lysis buffer (promega, usa). fluorescence was determined on a luminometer (modulus microplate, promega, usa), where relative light units were measured for each well. viability was measured using the mtt assay and measured on a spectrophotometer (thermo scientific, usa) at 595 nm. luciferase readings were expressed over mtt (rlu/mtt). relative infection was calculated by setting the vehicle control (etoh) to 100% relative infection.rna isolation and real time quantitative pcr (qpcr)for rna isolation from explants, tissue was placed into 800 μl qiazol ® in a 2 ml cryovial tubes (nunc, germany). samples were homogenized on ice using a hand-held homogeniser (tissueruptor®, qiagen, netherlands) with disposable probes (tissueruptor probes, qiagen, netherlands), for 20 second pulses, for up to 1 minute. homogenates were transferred to new microfuge tubes and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °c and rna was isolated using the rneasy tissue microarray kit (qiagen, netherlands), with an on-column dnase treatment. rna quality was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and only rna with 260/230 and 260/280 ratios of >1.8 was used.total rna (250 ng) was reverse-transcribed using the transcriptor first strand synthesis cdna kit (roche applied science, south africa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cdna samples were stored at −80 °c until use in subsequent real time qpcr reactions. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed using the bioline sensimix™ sybr® no rox kit (qt650-05, bioline usa) on a rotorgene 3000 (qiagen, netherlands) real time qpcr machine, according to manufacturer’s instructions. the steroid receptor primers and amplification profiles were as previously established76. ccr5 and cxcr4 were amplified with the following primer pairs: ccr5 - 5′ tggaccaagctatgcaggtg 3′ and 5′ cgtgtcacaagcccacagat 3′. cxcr4: - 5′gaaatgggctcaggggactat 3′ and 5′ ttcagccaacagcttccttgg 3′ with a ta of 55 °c and 60 °c respectively. cd4 primers and amplification profile were previously established77, while for gapdh the primers were as described by verhoog et al. (2011)78. relative transcript levels were determined using the established methods79, with vehicle control set to 1.flow cytometryflow cytometry was performed as previously described76 and tissue was digested as described in80 with a few modifications. ectocervical explant tissues were diced as described above but into smaller 0.5 mm3 pieces and six explant pieces per condition were placed into a volume of 500 ul of full rpmi media in separate wells of a 24-well plate in the presence of hormones and incubated for 48 hr or 7 days in a water jacket incubator. after 48 hr or 7 days, media was harvested and tissue pieces were washed with 1% pbs containing 1% c-s fcs (1% c-s fcspbs). tissue pieces (squares/blocks) were placed into a 1 ml eppendorf tube and digested with 5 µg/ml collagenase ii (cat no: 17101015, thermo fisher, usa) in 1 ml of complete hank balanced salt solution (hbss) with calcium and magnesium (lonza, germany) for 45 min on a rotator at 37 °c in a water jacket incubator. digestion for 25 or 45 min did not change total amount of cells, or the frequency of cells types investigated. digested tissue was passed through a 70 µm cell strainer (corning, usa) and washed two times with full rpmi media and a third time with 1% c-s fcspbs. filtered cells were collected and pelleted at 400 × g (thermoscientific, swing-bucket centrifuge). cells were washed twice with 1% c-s fcspbs, followed by staining in pbs (in the absence of protein) with the appropriate antibodies. explants were stained with zombie nir, anti-cd3 fitc, anti-cd4 pe-dazzle 594, anti-cd8 pe/cy5, anti-cd69 pe/cy7 and anti-ccr5 pe antibodies (biolegend, usa), at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. after staining, explants were washed with 1% c-s fcspbs and resuspended in 1 x cell fix solution (becton-dickinson, usa). samples were acquired using a lsrii becton-dickinson flow cytometer (becton-dickinson, usa) and analysed using flow jo software (version 10.1, treestar, inc, ashland, ore). only the single cellular population were analysed. dead cells were excluded from the scatter plots prior to analysis and negative gates were set using minus fluorescence one (mfo) controls. results are represented as either frequency (as a percentage of total) or expression (median fluorescence intensity or mfi]). relative fold change in frequency or expression levels was calculated by setting vehicle control (etoh) expression to 1.determination of protein levels of soluble mediatorssupernatants were collected from primary ectocervical explants into 2 ml cryovial tubes (nunc, germany) and stored at −80 °c for future use. choice of soluble mediators for analysis was based on those we deemed likely to be regulated by mpa as indicated from the literature17,18,19,20,24,81. we designed a panel for screening by luminex for those available, and by elisa for those not available by luminex. for luminex analysis, cytokine and chemokine secretion was measured using a millipore milliplex magplex-60 (merck, germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. plate were read using the luminex 200 pro (bio-rad, germany) at the sun immunology research group, university of stellenbosch (south africa) that had been validated and calibrated prior to the analysis. analytes included: il-1ra, il6, il8, eotaxin, mcp-1, and rantes. levels of some soluble mediators including hbd-2, hbd-3, ifn-γ (abts elisa development kit, peprotech, usa) fell below the detection limit (10 pg/ml) in our samples and hence were not determined. sample concentrations were determined using the equation generated for each individual cytokine or chemokine. relative fold change expression was determined by setting the vehicle control (vehicle, etoh) to 1. for elisas, il-8, il-6 and slp1 secretion was measured by the duoset elisa, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (r&d systems, usa).statistical analysisresults were analysed using graphpad prism (version 6) software (la jolla california, usa). data were tested for normalcy before parametric tests were performed using the d’agostino-pearson omnibus normality test for large data sets and the kolmogorov-smirnov test with dallal-wilkonson-lille for p value for small data sets (n < 6). for the hiv-1 replication experiments in the cervical explants, a repeated measures’ two-way anova was performed, with a post-hoc tukey test or a post-hoc sidak’s test to assess the significance between the treatments at each time point assayed. in order to determine the accumulation of p24 over the time course assayed, we used the area under the curve (auc) method to calculate total p24 accumulated over 5, 7 and 10 days post infection, and normalized these values to the vehicle control set to 1. where samples were treated with ligands at one time point, a one-way anova, with either a dunnet’s or tukey’s post-test comparing each group to control or each group to each other, was performed. for comparison between two samples, an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test was performed. for data that was non-parametric, a kruskal-wallis anova with a dunn’s multiple comparisons test was performed when comparing samples to each other. for non-parametric data compared to control, a wilcoxon signed rank test was performed, with the hypothetical median set to the control value of 1. additionally, when two groups were compared to each other, a non-parametric mann-whitney test was performed. data were expressed as mean ± sem on histograms or mean + sem on xy scatter charts, with n values given in each figure legend. where statistical significance of difference was obtained relative to a single control statistical significance is denoted by *, **, *** or **** to indicate p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, or p < 0.0001 respectively. where statistical significance of difference between two values was obtained, this is indicated with lines showing the sample sets which were significantly different from each other.resultsto investigate whether mpa directly increases hiv-1 replication at key sites in the lower fgt, fresh non-polarized ectocervical or endocervical tissue explants from hiv-1 negative, pre-menopausal donors, not on contraception, were pre-treated for 48 hr in parallel with vehicle, and equimolar concentrations of mpa or net. thereafter they were infected with infectious molecular clones (imcs) of either x4-tropic (hiv-1pnl4.3) or r5-tropic (hiv-1bal_renilla) virus and viral p24 levels were monitored at days 3, 5, 7 and 10, in the presence of vehicle, mpa or net.mpa increases r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in cervical explants at peak serum levels of dmpa-im usersincubation of ectocervical explant tissue with 100 nm mpa significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 replication compared to vehicle in matched donor incubations by 1.2 to 1.3-fold after 7–10 days (fig. 1a). dose response analysis revealed no significant effects with 10 or 1 nm mpa for any of the time points up to 10 days (fig. 1b,c). incubation of endocervical explant tissue with 100 nm mpa also significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 replication compared to vehicle in matched donor incubations (fig. 1d) by about 3-fold after 5 days, with no significant changes at later time points (fig. 1d). however, 10 nm mpa significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in endocervical explant tissue compared to vehicle in matched donor incubations by about 1.2- fold after 7 and 10 days (fig. 1e). for detailed statistical outputs for each data set at each time point see supplementary tables s3 and s4. for raw p24 accumulation curves (pg/ml) for select individual donors see supplementary fig. s3. an alternative method of analysis by calculating the auc showed similar results, as illustrated for ectocervical explants incubated with 100 nm mpa (see supplementary fig. s4). supplementary figs s3 and s4 show that some donors exhibited much greater responses than others to mpa, suggesting donor-specific effects. the relatively small donor numbers did not allow correlation with any extrinsic donor characteristics, including menstrual cycle phase (see supplementary table s2). taken together, the data show that mpa increases hiv-1 replication under our conditions in both ectocervical tissue and endocervical tissue in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations detected in the serum of dmpa-im users.figure 1mpa increases r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in cervical explants in a dose-dependent manner and at peak serum levels of dmpa-im users. (a–c) ectocervical or (d,e) endocervical explants for each donor were treated in parallel with vehicle (etoh [0.1% v/v]) or 1, 10 or 100 nm mpa for 48 hr after which tissue was infected. washed and left for varying times in the presence of vehicle or the different concentrations of mpa. media were collected at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post infection and assayed for p24 levels by elisa. infection with r5 hiv-1bal-renilla was measured and relative infection was plotted relative to day 3 vehicle set to 1. relative infection for pooled data was used to compare the fold-change in infection for matched incubations with vehicle or mpa, since the absolute infection levels as measured by p24 assays at day 3 varied in a donor-dependent manner. each condition was performed at least in triplicate. for data set (a), seven of these were performed as independent donor experiments comparing only mpa vs vehicle in parallel. an additional 10 experiments were performed independently with mpa vs net vs vehicle, used in fig. 2a, and the mpa vs vehicle data only from these 10 data sets were also used in (a). mpa vs vehicle data from three experiments shown in fig. 3b, were also used in (a), making the total for n = 20 independent donor data sets shown in (a). results of b and c are representative of (b) nine and (c) five independent donor experiments. (d) mpa vs vehicle data are from six experiments done in parallel with net, also shown in fig. 2b (e). results are shown from 5 independent donor experiments. xy plots are representative of mean + sem. statistical significance was determined by comparing mpa to the vehicle control using a repeated measures two-way anova with a post hoc sidak’s test, with *, **, *** and **** denoting p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively. detailed statistical analysis is shown in supplementary tables s3 and s4. all data sets except one had all data time points. for (a) one of the donors (49) experiments was missing a day 5 value and was therefore excluded from the statistical analysis, although it is included in the final figure.full size imagempa unlike net increases hiv-1 replication in cervical explant tissuetreatment of ectocervical explants in parallel with either vehicle, 100 nm mpa or 100 nm net showed that mpa significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 infection relative to vehicle and net, while net had no effect relative to vehicle at any of the time points (fig. 2a). similar to results in fig. 1a, 100 nm mpa significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 infection by about 1.2-fold after 3, 7 and 10 days, relative to vehicle (fig. 2a). similar results were observed for matched incubations with vehicle, 100 nm mpa or 100 nm net in endocervical explant tissue, although given the larger error bars in this group of donor experiments and the less robust infection at longer time points, significant effects on hiv-1 replication were only observed for 100 nm mpa at day 5 relative to vehicle (fig. 2b). plotting the auc data showed similar results, with 100 nm mpa significantly increasing r5-tropic hiv-1 infection compared to net after 10 days, while 100 nm net showed no significant difference compared to vehicle (see supplementary fig. s4). unlike the results with r5-tropic virus, fig. 2c shows that 100 nm mpa has no effect on x4-tropic hiv-1 replication over time compared to the matched vehicle control (fig. 2c), while 100 nm net significantly decreased x4 hiv-1 replication by about 1.5-fold over time, compared to both the vehicle control at days 7 (1.6-fold) and 10 (1.4-fold), and to mpa at day 5 (1.3-fold), in ectocervical explants (fig. 2c). supplementary table s4 shows the detailed statistical outputs for each data set at each time point. for raw p24 accumulation curves (pg/ml) for select individual donors see supplementary fig. s3. taken together, the data show that 100 nm mpa increases r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in primary ectocervical and endocervical explants, while equimolar net has no effect, and that the effects of mpa on hiv-1 replication are selective for r5- tropic and not x4-tropic virus.figure 2mpa

increases hiv-1 replication in ectocervical explants via the gr and/or prhaving shown that mpa increases hiv-1 replication in the cervical explants, we sought to determine if the mechanism involves steroid receptor signalling. initially, we investigated whether steroid receptor mrnas are expressed in ectocervical tissue. we show for the first time that ectocervical tissue expresses detectable mrna for all the steroid receptors (fig. 3a). thereafter, we used the gr- and pr-selective antagonist ru486 to further investigate the possible involvement of the gr and/or the pr in mediating the observed mpa effect. as observed previously, 100 nm mpa significantly increased r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in the ectocervical explants while ru486 significantly decreased the mpa-induced response. there was no significant difference between the response to vehicle and ru486 alone. for detailed statistical outputs for each data set at each time point see supplementary table s5. for raw p24 accumulation curves (pg/ml) for select individual donors see supplementary fig. s3. the data suggest that the gr and/or the pr mediate the mpa-induced increased hiv-1 replication in ectocervical explant tissue.figure 3ectocervical explants express all the steroid receptors and the gr/pr antagonist ru486 significantly reduces the mpa-induced increase in hiv-1bal replication. (a) ectocervical rna was screened for steroid receptor and gapdh mrna using rt-pcr. patient donors and controls are labelled on the gel. positive controls used were expression vectors containing the coding regions of each steroid receptor, respectively. negative control was the no template control (dh20). cropped images of stained agarose gels are shown here, while the cropping is explained, and full-length images are shown in supplementary fig. s5. (b) ectocervical tissue was incubated for 48 hr in parallel with vehicle, 100 nm mpa, 100 nm ru486, or combinations thereof, followed by r5-tropic hiv-1 infection and media collection at days 3, 5, 7 and 10 post infection. relative infection was plotted as described for figs 1 and 2, with the xy plot representative of mean + sem. statistical analysis was by repeated measures two-way anova, with a post hoc tukeys’s test. statistical significance is denoted by * to indicate p < 0.05 for vehicle vs. mpa, while letters a, b and c represent (p < 0.05), (p < 0.01) and (p < 0.001), respectively, for significance between mpa vs. mpa/ru486. detailed statistical analysis is shown in supplementary table s5. all data sets had all data time points.full size imagethe mechanism appears to be independent of soluble mediatorswe investigated whether changes in soluble mediators induced by 100 nm mpa in cervical explant tissue would affect r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in an add-back experiment using the tzm-bl cervical indicator cell line. the results showed no effect on hiv-1 replication with medium harvested after ectocervical tissue had been incubated for 48 hr with 100 nm of either mpa or net, as compared to vehicle, suggesting that changes in soluble mediators are not involved (fig. 4). this result is consistent with our analysis of levels of selected cytokines and chemokines by luminex and elisa, which revealed no significant changes in il6, il8, rantes, mcp-1, il-1ra, slpi and eotaxin expression levels after treatment with 100 nm mpa or net for 48 hr, compared to vehicle (fig. 5 and see supplementary table s6).figure 4supernatants of ectocervical explants incubated with mpa or net have no effect on r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in tzm-bl cells. tzm-bl cells were treated for 24 hr with 1:10 diluted supernatants collected from ectocervical explants previously treated with 100 nm mpa, 100 nm net, 10 µm maraviroc (mvc) or with 0.1% etoh, (v/v) or 0.1% (v/v) dmso as vehicle controls. additionally, tzm-bl cells were treated for 24 hr with control rpmi media incubated for 48 hr with 100 nm mpa or net or vehicle control. cells were infected with 20 iu of hiv-1bal-renilla virus or control virus (uninfected) in the presence of treatments. cells were harvested 48 hr after infection and infection determined with brightglo luciferase. luciferase readings were normalized to cell viability mtt values. the histogram shows the results of nineteen independent explant supernatants, assayed over three independent experiments each performed in duplicate or triplicate and plotted as mean + sem. statistical significance was assessed using a non-parametric anova with a post hoc dunn’s test between conditions with * denoting p < 0.05 between dmso and mvc.full size imagefigure 5mpa and net have no significant effects on select secreted protein levels after 48 hr incubation in ectocervical explants. ectocervical explant tissue samples were stimulated with 100 nm mpa or 100 nm net (a–g), or 10 nm mpa (h–l) and a vehicle control etoh (0.1% v/v) for 48 hr at 37 °c, after which supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °c until use in a duoset elisa, (r&d systems) (a–c) or in a merck millipore luminex assay (d–l). in (a–l) we show histograms of pooled results from five to seventeen donors, plotted as mean ± sem. donor numbers varied for each cytokine due to some donor samples falling below detection limits. no significant differences were detected between conditions using non- para metric kruskal-wallis one-way anova with a dunn’s post-test.full size imagempa, unlike net, increases ccr5 and cd4 mrna levels in cervical tissuehaving shown that mpa but not net increases r5-tropic hiv-1 replication in explant tissue, we next investigated whether these responses were due to differential effects on cd4 or hiv-1 co-receptor mrna expression levels. we found that incubation of ectocervical tissue explants for 48 hr with 100 nm mpa significantly increased cd4 mrna levels by 2.6-fold ±0.87 sem (p = 0.042), while 100 nm net had no effect (fig. 6a). moreover, 100 nm mpa significantly increased expression of ccr5 mrna by 2.8-fold ±0.82-sem (p = 0.0215), while equimolar net had no effects (fig. 6b). neither 100 nm mpa nor 100 nm net had any significant effect on cxcr4 mrna levels (fig. 6c). the upregulation of ccr5 expression by mpa (2.54 fold ±0.8321 sem) was inhibited by co-incubation with ru486 (1.216 fold ±0.2386 sem) in the ectocervical explant tissue, supporting a role for the gr and/or pr in this response (fig. 6d) as found for mpa-induced hiv-1 replication.figure 6mpa, unlike net, increases ccr5 mrna levels in cervical explant tissue in a gr/pr-dependent manner. (a–c) ectocervical explant tissue were stimulated with 100 nm mpa, 100 nm net or vehicle 48 hr or (d) treated for 48 hr with vehicle control (etoh) (0.1% v/v ethanol), 100 nm mpa, 100 nm ru486 (ru), or combinations thereof (ru/mpa). rna was isolated, cdna was synthesised and relative ccr5 mrna levels were determined by real time qpcr, normalised to gapdh. relative fold change in expression was determined by setting vehicle control to 1. (a) shows the results for cd4 from 10 (mpa) and 9 (net), while (b) shows results for ccr5 from 12 (mpa and net) and (c) shows results for cxcr4 from 11 (mpa) and 8 (net), independent donor experiments, respectively. (d) the histogram shows pooled results from five independent experiments with vehicle set to one, plotted as mean ± sem. statistical significance was assessed by a non-parametric one-way anova kruskal-wallis with post hoc dunn’s tests between conditions (d) or a non-parametric wilcoxon signed rank test with the median set to 1 (a–c).full size imagempa, unlike net, increases the relative frequency of cd4+ cells and activated monocytes in cervical tissuetowards understanding the differential effects of mpa and net on hiv-1 replication, we investigated whether 100 nm mpa or net affected the frequency, activation or ccr5 levels of cd3+ and cd14+ cells in ectocervical tissue by flow cytometry after 48 hr or 7 days. for the gating strategy see supplementary fig. s6. most of the cells analysed after treatment for 48 hr or 7 days were viable, although there was evidence for some cell death in about 10% of samples (see supplementary fig. s7 and supplementary table s7). neither mpa nor net appeared to have any significant effects on frequency or activation (as assessed by cd69) of cd4+, cd8+ or cd14+ cells, or their ccr5 expression levels, after 48 hr (see supplementary table s8). interestingly, incubation for 7 days revealed that 100 nm mpa significantly increased the relative frequency of cd4+ expressing t cells and activated cd69+ cd14+ cells, unlike 100 nm net, relative to vehicle control for each matched ectocervical donor tissue (fig. 7 and see supplementary table s9a). no significant differences were detected between the effects of mpa and net on the relative frequency of cd69+ or total cd8+ or cd14+ cells (fig. 7 and see supplementary table s9a). representative scatter plots showing an increased frequency of cd4+ cells, but not cd8+ cells are given in supplementary fig. s8. furthermore, mpa and net had no effect on the relative frequency of ccr5-expressing cells or the density (as measured by median florescent intensity (mfi)) of ccr5 expression (fig. 7 and see supplementary table s9a and b) after 7 days. the total frequencies of cd3, cd4, cd8 and cd14 were lower after 7 days compared to 48 hr, with the most dramatic decrease seen for cd4+ cells (see supplementary tables s8a and s9a). concomitantly, the cd4/cd8 ratio was also 4-fold lower after 7 days compared to 48 hr. for the absolute numbers of cd4+ and cd4+ ccr5+ cells for individual donors see supplementary table s10. no significant change in cd4 density (mfi) was observed between treatment groups (see supplementary table s11).figure 7mpa significantly increases relative frequency of cd4+ cells and cd14+ cd69+ expressing cells after 7 days. ectocervical explant tissue were stimulated in parallel with vehicle (etoh) or 100 nm mpa or 100 nm net for 7 days after which the relative levels of (a) cd3+, cd4+ and cd8+ and cd14 t cells (b) cd69 and (c) ccr5 or (d) cd69, ccr5 expressing cd3+, cd4+ and cd8+ and cd14 t cells were determined using flow cytometry. results show the fold changes of frequency of 8 independent experiments, where the % cells for vehicle for each donor sample was set to 1 and the relative frequency for matched mpa and net incubations was calculated relative to that donor vehicle value. (e) cd4/cd8 ratios of the 8 independent experiments were determined. histograms are representative of mean ± sem. statistical significance was determined by using a non-parametric kruskal-wallis one-way anova with a dunn’s post-test with * or ** denoting p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively.full size imagediscussion we show for the first time that physiologically relevant concentrations of mpa have direct effects on cervical explant tissue ex vivo, to significantly increase r5-tropic, but not x4-tropic hiv-1 replication. the effects of mpa on r5-tropic viral replication in endocervical tissue are likely to be physiologically relevant, since 10 nm mpa falls well within the range of average reported peak serum levels of dmpa-im users, with the cmax after 8 injections with dmpa-im being reportedly about 11 nm55. however, it should be noted that the concentration of mpa and net in genital tract tissue is unknown and may or may not differ substantially from that measured in serum. since 1 nm mpa had no significant effects on hiv-1 replication, it is possible that the lower dose dmpa-sc may have less of an effect on hiv-1 replication than dmpa-im in fgt cervical tissue in vivo, although the effects ex vivo may not be translatable in vivo. our findings showing no significant increase with 100 nm net suggest that net-en is unlikely to affect hiv-1 replication even at peak serum net concentrations via any mechanism that is conserved in our ex vivo model. interestingly we observed similar results and mpa dose-dependency for hiv-1 replication in pbmcs65 suggesting similar types of hiv-1 target cells and mpa-increased infection mechanisms are involved in the genital tract as in pbmcs. bearing in mind the limitations of extrapolating ex vivo to in vivo data, our current results are consistent with the limited clinical epidemiological data showing a significant increased risk of hiv-1 infection for dmpa-im compared to net-en users. it would be ideal to perform these studies with transmission-founder clinical isolates, but other reports have shown that these do not readily replicate detectably in ex vivo tissue models82. our findings further suggest that at least some effects of mpa in vivo may occur via direct effects on fgt endocervical and ectocervical tissue to increase hiv-1 replication, unlike for net.hiv-1 acquisition in the fgt is likely to involve multiple mechanisms, including effects on hiv-1 replication12. several in vivo mechanisms would not be detected in our non-polarized ex vivo model, such as changes in fgt barrier integrity and permeability. indeed data from mouse and clinical models show that mpa increases the permeability of the genital barrier15 and increases hiv-1 transcytosis in primary genital epithelial cells31. the ex vivo explant model also has some other limitations83, but several biological repeats and using fresh tissue still enable meaningful significant results84,85. nevertheless, the advantages of the ex vivo model are that direct effects on the fgt relevant to hiv- 1 acquisition and replication using the same known concentrations of specific progestins compared to vehicle can be investigated in parallel in the same donor sample, unlike for clinical studies, which also involve indirect effects and multiple confounding behavioural factors such as condom usage.other mechanisms whereby contraceptives may affect hiv-1 acquisition in the fgt include changes in soluble mediators of inflammation and innate immunity12. several clinical studies show a correlation between increased fgt inflammation and increased hiv-1 acquisition86,87. however, the reported effects of contraceptives in the fgt on these mediators, including il-6, il-8 and rantes, are inconsistent13,16,17,18,19,88,89,90. expression of these and other select mediators are regulated directly by mpa in genital tract primary or cell line models ex vivo, both in a pro- and an anti-inflammatory manner, at physiologically relevant concentrations, but not by net, where investigated31,32,41,91,92. whether mpa or net have direct effects on expression of such soluble mediators in cervical tissue is unknown. the results of our add-back experiments in the tzm-bl indicator cell line suggest that mpa increases r5 hiv-1 replication without a requirement for detectable changes in levels of select soluble secreted mediators from the explant tissue. this is supported by our lack of detection of any significant changes in levels of select soluble mediators in explant media in response to both 10 or 100 nm mpa or 100 nm net. nevertheless, our findings do not exclude a role for changes in other soluble mediators not investigated, nor the possibility that significant small effects undetectable by the power of our study do occur with the mediators investigated, or that longer exposure to progestins may reveal significant changes.another possible mechanism whereby contraceptives may increase hiv-1 acquisition in the fgt is via increased frequency of cd4+ ccr5+ t cells or density of ccr5 expression on cd4+ t cells12. this is consistent with our data showing that mpa increased r5-tropic and not x4-tropic viral replication in ectocervical explant tissue. ccr5 is reported to be the predominant co-receptor for mucosal hiv-1 infection in humans and is expressed on t cells, dendritic cells and macrophages in the mucosal tissue of the fgt74,93, while ccr5+ cd4+ cells are the primary hiv-1 targets for infection94,95,96,97, consistent with results from another ex vivo cervico-vaginal tissue model showing predominant r5-tropic infection98. our novel finding that mpa but not net increases total cervical tissue levels of ccr5 but not cxcr4 mrna suggests that a likely mechanism whereby mpa but not net increases hiv-1 replication in the explant model is via upregulation of ccr5 expression levels on hiv-1 target cells. this is consistent with data showing that cytobrushes from women on injectable contraceptives (76% on dmpa-im) contain a greater frequency of ccr5+ cd4+ cells and increased density of ccr5 on cd4+ cells, compared to no contraception13. similarly, the frequency of ccr5 expressing cells is significantly increased in vaginal biopsy tissue of women on dmpa-im, compared to no contraception99. others, however, did not detect any change in ccr5 expression levels on t cells in cervicovaginal lavages (cvl)17, or mucosa cells isolated from cytobrush samples from women on dmpa-im88, possibly due to differences in the intrinsic factors of sample populations, methodology or differences in cells between lavage, cytobrushes and tissue. interestingly, frequency of ccr5+ cd4+ t cells was shown to be higher in dmpa-im-treated macaques than in an e2-treated group in vaginal tissue100, suggesting a similar mechanism in macaques. however, our flow cytometry analysis of collagenase digested tissue did not reveal any changes in density of ccr5 expression (mfi) or the frequency of expression of ccr5 on cd3+ or cd14+ cells, after 48 hr or 7 days exposure to 100 nm mpa. furthermore, flow cytometry showed that after 48 hr, 96% of cd4+ and 99% of cd8+ cells and after 7 days 88% of cd4+ and 88% of cd8+ cells, already expressed ccr5, independent of treatment, making it unlikely that a further increase could be detected or relevant.our cd14+ findings at 48 hr are consistent with previous reports showing cd14+ cells to be the predominant cell type in ectocervical tissue80,101. the overall decrease in different cell type frequencies between 48 hr and 7 days may be indicative of a general depletion of cd3+ and cd14+ cells over the 7 days in culture, in particular the cd4+ cells, or an overall increase in other cell types. the higher cd4/cd8 ratio for vehicle-treated tissue at 48 hr compared to 7 days was similar to a previously reported cd4/cd8 ratio in ectocervical explant tissue80. however, comparisons between our 48 hr and 7 day data should be interpreted with caution since the 48 hr donors were not matched with the 7 day donors and there is a high degree of inter-donor variability at both time points. the reported high percentages of ccr5 and cd69 expressing cells in our study are consistent with findings by others that the majority of explant cd4+ cells express ccr5 or cd69 following three days in culture102, as well as findings from freshly harvested cervico-vaginal tissue explants where the majority of cd4+ and cd14+ cells express ccr5103. in contrast, others report lower percentages for ccr5 expressing cd4+ cells (28%) and cd8+ cells (16%) within a cd3+ population of t cells made up of 41% cd4+ or 59% cd8+ from freshly harvested and digested tissue80 or cd4+ cells harvested for cervical lavages (cvl)104. differences in cell populations between studies may indicate that cells have undergone different degrees of change in surface marker expression, general immune activation, induction of hypoxia or apoptosis82,105, or induction of wound repair upon mechanical stress105 due to the harvesting procedures used to generate single cells for flow cytometry analysis and may not accurately reflect prior cell populations. alternatively, differences may be due to intrinsic donor population differences. disparity in digestion protocols, with different collagenases exerting differential effects on ccr5 expression levels106 or a variety of sampling sources of cervical samples (cytobrushes, lavages), which are shown to have varied levels of cd4+ cells80,104,107,108, may also account for such differences. we do show that the cells subjected to flow cytometry analysis after 7 days of exposure to 100 nm mpa remain viable. general immune activation and increased ccr5 expression induced by flow cytometry sample preparation could have masked an mpa-induced increase in ccr5 expression. in support of this possibility, we have recently shown that pbmcs investigated by flow cytometry without the collagenase procedure have lower basal ccr5 expression and exhibited an increased ccr5 density (mfi) and frequency of ccr5 expressing cd4+ (21.03% ± 4.466), cd8+ and cd14+ cells after incubation with mpa for 7 days65. however, this could also reflect real differences in the pbmc versus tissue immune responses to mpa13. immunohistochemical staining on whole tissue slices may be a better way to decipher the cell type (s) origin of the increased ccr5 mrna shown in our study, which could still possibly be from cd4+, cd8+ or cd14+ cells as found for pbmcs, or alternatively, involve other cell types not investigated by flow cytometry, such as epithelial cells or stromal fibroblasts also present in cervical tissue and expressing ccr5109. future experiments using markers for these different cell types could be used to address these questions but are beyond the scope of the present study.the increase in the relative frequency of cd4+ cells after 7 days coupled to the lack of possible recruitment of additional cells in an explant model suggests that the upregulation of the cd4 receptors on cd3+ cells not previously expressing cd4 could be a possible explanation for the increased hiv replication observed with mpa, since cd4 is also required for hiv-1 infection. consistent with this possibility is that after 48 hr we detected an increase in cd4 mrna. alternatively, one could speculate that mpa partially prevents down-regulation of cd4 surface markers on cd3+ cells, compared to vehicle and net. other studies did not detect an increase in the frequency of cd4+ cells by immunohistochemical staining of vaginal biopsies from women on dmpa-im compared to no hormone controls110, possibly due to differences in methodology or target tissue. our explant data are consistent with our findings in pbmcs where we also see an increased relative frequency of cd4+ cd3+ t cells and an increased expression of both cd4 and ccr5 but not cxcr4 mrna in tzm-bl cells with mpa65. interestingly, a recent clinical study also supports a role for increased ccr5 expression and activation of systemic cd4+ t cells in increasing infectability of ccr5+ cd4+ t cells in pbmcs from women on dmpa-im111. however, it should be noted that fgt and systemic hiv-1 target cells are different, although some similarities exist13,112. while the role of cd69+ cd14+ monocytes in hiv-1 infection has not been elucidated, several studies show that changes in activation of cd14+ cells such as macrophages, which are permissible to r5 hiv-1 infection113, are reported to change their susceptibility to hiv-1 infection114,115,116. our results showing increased activation of macrophages in the cervical explants by mpa after 7 days are consistent with activated macrophages playing a role in driving increased hiv-1 replication in cd4+ ccr5+ t cells in cervical tissue. the finding that removal of cd14+ cells from pbmcs inhibits the effect of mpa on increased hiv-1 replication30 also appears to be consistent with our study, suggesting that monocytes play a role in increased infection of t cells by mpa. alternatively, or in addition there may be an increase in hiv-1 replication in monocytes113.our data collectively suggest that the mechanism via which mpa, unlike net, increases hiv-1 replication in cervical tissue is mediated via the gr. although we show that cervical tissue express gr, pr and ar, it has been previously established that at 100 nm mpa, only the gr is likely to discriminate between mpa and net32,34,36,117,118. mpa and net exert differential effects on expression of select genes at 100 nm via the gr in several model systems32,36,37,38. additionally, mpa and net are both pr agonists with affinities in the nanomolar range34,118 and thus would be expected to elicit similar responses at 100 nm, if via the pr. the pr that we detected in the cervical explant tissue most likely originates from fibroblast cells119, and not from cd3+ or cd14+ cell types or primary epithelial cells32,76,119. since stromal fibroblasts are reported to enhance hiv-1 infection in susceptible cd4+ t cells120, it is also possible that the pr plays a role in hiv-1 replication in our explant model, although unlikely in contributing to the differential actions of mpa and net. in support of a role for the gr in explant tissue, we observed similar differential effects with mpa and net on hiv-1 replication in pbmcs and tzm-bl cells, which do not express pr65, as in the current study. using a more specific gr or pr antagonist would have been helpful to discriminate between gr- and pr-mediated effects. however, some such reported antagonists121 are not commercially available. we did investigate the use of one non-commercial and reportedly gr-specific antagonist122, but this had a very low affinity for the gr in our hands36, such that no antagonism would have been observed even at 1 µm if the gr was involved and its use was thus not suitable for these experiments. further experiments would be required to definitively establish the roles of the gr and pr in these responses in tissue.in conclusion , our data support a mechanism whereby mpa, at concentrations found in serum of dmpa-im users, unlike net, directly increases r5 but not x4 hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t cells via increasing expression of cd4 and ccr5 co-receptors on t cells and activation of monocytes, to increase hiv-1 infection in cervical tissue. the detected differences in the actions of mpa compared to net are likely to be gr-mediated. our findings suggest that mpa could increase hiv-1 acquisition by the above mechanism once the virus has crossed the epithelial barrier, in the absence of factors such as hypoestrogenism and changes in the microbiome and soluble mediators. however, our data do not exclude a contributing role for any of these or other mechanisms. furthermore, our data do not exclude the possibility that the mpa but not net responses require the presence of other signalling molecules, such as il-2, present in the media. indeed, it is likely that mpa, acting alone or together with other signalling pathways, exerts effects on multiple genes and physiological processes relevant to several mechanisms involved in hiv-1 acquisition, given the ubiquitous expression of the gr. while it is unclear and difficult to establish what the impact of the mpa-induced increased hiv-1 replication in the ex vivo model would be on hiv-1 acquisition in vivo, this study does suggest at least one mechanism whereby the impact may be different for mpa compared to net. our study adds to the body of evidence showing that mpa and net act differently regarding several biological mechanisms relevant to hiv-1 acquisition and supports disaggregation of dmpa-im and net-en regarding hiv-1 acquisition risk.

Integrated systems approach defines the antiviral pathways conferring protection by the RV144 HIV vaccine,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08854-2,Research,20 February 2019,yes,"the rv144 vaccine trial showed reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition by 31.2%, although mechanisms that led to protection remain poorly understood. here we identify transcriptional correlates for reduced hiv-1 acquisition after vaccination. we assess the transcriptomic profile of blood collected from 223 participants and 40 placebo recipients. pathway-level analysis of hiv-1 negative vaccinees reveals that type i interferons that activate the irf7 antiviral program and type ii interferon-stimulated genes implicated in antigen-presentation are both associated with a reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition. in contrast, genes upstream and downstream of nf-κb, mtorc1 and host genes required for viral infection are associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition among vaccinees and placebo recipients, defining a vaccine independent association with hiv-1 acquisition. our transcriptomic analysis of rv144 trial samples identifies irf7 as a mediator of protection and the activation of mtorc1 as a correlate of the risk of hiv-1 acquisition.
introduction the rv144 trial evaluated the efficacy of alvac-hiv (vcp1521) prime and aidsvax b/e (gp120) boost strategy adjuvanted in alum to prevent human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) acquisition. participants enrolled in the rv144 clinical trial were followed up to 3 years after a series of four immunizations. the vaccine reduced the risk of hiv-1 acquisition at 3 years following completion of the vaccination series by 31.2% when compared to placebo (modified intention-to-treat analysis, likelihood-ratio test: p = 0.0385)1. correlates of risk studies showed that two nonneutralizing antibody responses measured 2 weeks after vaccination were associated with hiv-1 acquisition: levels of iga recognizing the envelope (env) region of hiv-1 associated with a higher risk of hiv-1 acquisition (similar to the risk of placebo recipients) and levels of igg recognizing the v1/v2 regions of hiv-1 env associated with a decreased risk of hiv-1 acquisition2. more recently, cd4 + t cells polyfunctionality measured in response to env stimulation (i.e., polyfunctionality score (pfs)) was associated with a decreased risk of hiv-1 acquisition in rv144 vaccinees3, while two host human leukocyte antigen (hla) alleles (dbq1*06 and dpb1*13) were shown to modulate the hiv-specific antibody responses associated with hiv-1 acquisition4. the benefit of combining these correlates, that underlie different arms of the immune response (humoral and cellular), to predict the risk of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees has not been assessed. moreover, a specific innate immune response that can help prime cellular and humoral immune effector mechanisms are yet to be defined.despite the identification of correlates of risk for the rv144 vaccine that could potentially be correlates of protection5, the mechanisms that lead to vaccine conferred-protection are still unknown. igg antibodies elicited by the vaccine have been suggested to trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (adcc) by binding fc receptors on the surface of natural killer cells, whereas iga antibodies compete with igg antibodies for binding to hiv-1 env and thus abrogate adcc in vaccinees6. conversely, the alvac vector has been reported to trigger cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors sensing double-stranded dna leading to the activation of irf3/irf7 and the induction of an innate immune antiviral response that could prevent hiv-1 infection7. understanding the mechanisms that led to rv144 vaccine-conferred protection could offer new insights into the development of more effective hiv vaccines.in this study, we assessed the transcriptomic profile of in vitro stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) taken from 223 vaccinees and 40 placebo-recipient two weeks after the last immunization with the rv144 vaccine (or placebo). we identified that ifnγ stimulated genes are associated with reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition among vaccinees. genes downstream of nf-κb and mtorc1 required for viral infection or replication are instead associated with increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition in both vaccinees and placebo recipients, with a mechanism independent of the vaccine-induced immune response.resultsthe rv144 vaccine induces ifnγ, nf-κb, and mtorc1 pathwaysas an initial step, a pilot study was conducted to identify (through differential gene-expression analysis) and down-select (through clustering) rv144 vaccine-induced transcriptomic signatures that would then be tested for their association with hiv-1 acquisition2 (fig. 1). we compared the transcriptomic profile of in vitro hiv-1 env-stimulated pbmcs obtained pre-immunization and 2 weeks after the last immunization from 40 vaccine recipients and 10 placebo recipients; all 50 participants were hiv-1 negative at the last follow-up visit (supplementary tables 1 and 2)2. linear regression models followed by gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) were used to identify pathways that were differentially regulated when comparing the vaccine and placebo groups (see methods and supplementary data 1–3). linear regression revealed that the expression of 2946 genes was altered postimmunization (differentially expressed between the vaccine and placebo groups, limma: moderated t test p ≤ 0.05); none of these genes showed differential expression after correction for multiple testing. gsea identified 11 pathways significantly enriched among genes induced postimmunization compared to pre-immunization in env-stimulated pbmcs of vaccinees while none could be detected in env-stimulated pbmcs of placebo recipients (db: hallmark, gsea: false-discovery rate (fdr) ≤ 5%, fig. 2a). sample level enrichment analysis (slea), a method allowing to average expression of genes of a given pathway per sample, was used to quantify the enrichment of those 11 pathways for each sample of the pilot study. these 11 pathways were separated into four groups based on their correlation across samples (fig. 2b and supplementary fig. 1). in vaccinees, env stimulation led to the induction of genes part of the ifnγ response pathway (englobing as well ifnα response genes), genes implicated in nf-κb signaling, genes downstream of mtorc1 as well as genes associated to allograft rejection, i.e., genes triggered by t-cell activation. known ifnγ response genes specifically induced in rv144 vaccinees included genes implicated in antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i (fcgr1a, hla-b, hla-g, icam18, tap1) and by mhc class ii (cd74, hla-dqa1, hla-dma, hla-drb1; supplementary data 4). several of those mediate antiviral responses (ifih19, myd8810, trafd111) or have described antiviral effects against hiv-1 (apol6, lgals3bp, rsad2; supplementary data 4). stimulation of pbmcs with hiv-1 env was not associated with increased expression of these genes in placebo recipients (fig. 2c). likewise, several genes coding for members of the nf-κb transcriptional complex (nfkbia, rel), genes encoding upstream activators of the nf-κb transcriptional activity (birc3, il1b, ripk2, tank, tnf) as well as several nf-κb transcriptional targets (cxcl2, icam1, il6, il8, sdc4) were specifically induced in env stimulated cells from rv144 vaccinees (supplementary data 4). several mtorc1 downstream targets (gclc, scd, tfrc) were induced as well by env stimulation of pbmcs from rv144 vaccinees (supplementary data 4). together these results highlight ifnγ-, nf-κb-, and mtorc1-regulated genes as major transcriptional targets of the rv144 vaccine in env-stimulated pbmcs.fig. 1study overview. four analysis steps were used to identify transcriptomic markers of risk of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees. a first transcriptomic dataset of blood collected from 40 hiv-1 negative vaccinees and 10 hiv-1 negative placebo recipients prevaccination and 2 weeks after vaccination was used to identify pathways modulated by the rv144 vaccine (step 1). a second independent transcriptomic dataset of blood collected from 183 case–control vaccinees (including 31 infected participants) and 30 placebos (including 17 infected participants), 2 weeks after vaccination was used to identify pathways associated with hiv-1 acquisition. logistic regression was used to build a multi-omics classifier of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees (step 3) and a projection-based integrative analysis was used to associate the different omics to identify mechanistic mediators of vaccine response (step 4). three elements

vaccinees but not in placebo recipients (db: hallmark, gsea: fdr ≤ 5%). b sample-enrichment analysis (slea) of those 11 pathways followed by clustering revealed that those pathways could be separated

slea z-score inferior to 0 corresponds to a pathway with genes downregulated in that samplefull size imageifnγ pathway is associated with a reduced risk of acquisitionto determine if changes in gene expression were associated with hiv-1 acquisition, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of hiv-1 env in vitro stimulated pbmcs obtained 2 weeks after the last immunization from 183 vaccine recipients part of the case–control study2 that included 30 participants that acquired hiv-1 after vaccination (cases) and 153 participants that remained hiv-1 negative during the 3 year follow-up (controls). in addition to case–control samples, this dataset also included 30 placebo recipients, 17 of which acquired hiv-1 after vaccination, and 13 that remained hiv-1 negative (supplementary tables 3 and 4). we used linear regression models and gsea to assess the association of the four pathways induced by the rv144 vaccine with hiv-1 acquisition; this analysis was performed separately for vaccinees and placebo recipients. a total of 2058 genes were differentially expressed between participants that acquired hiv-1 and those that remained hiv-1 negative within the placebo group, while 3009 genes were differentially expressed between those two groups of participants in the vaccine group (limma: t test p ≤ 0.05); none of these genes remained significative after correction for multiple testing. our analysis revealed that three out of the four pathways induced by the rv144 vaccine (described above) were significantly associated with hiv-1 acquisition in the vaccine group, namely genes part of the ifnγ response pathway, genes implicated in nf-κb signaling and genes downstream of mtorc1 (gsea: fdr ≤ 0.05; fig. 3). the ifnγ response pathway was unique in its association with a lower risk of hiv-1 acquisition. in contrast, the remaining two pathways, nf-κb and mtorc1 signaling, were associated with higher risk of hiv-1 acquisition for rv144 vaccinees (fig. 3, supplementary table 5, supplementary data 5 and 6).fig. 3ifnγ response associated with the reduction of the risk of hiv-1 infection in vaccinees. dotplot presenting the association between the pathways induced by the rv144 vaccine and hiv-1 infection status, separately for vaccinees and placebo recipients. gene-expression of 183 vaccine recipients, 30 cases and 153 controls, and 30 placebo recipients, of which 17 were infected, were used for this analysis. gsea was performed and identified one pathway associated with the reduction of the risk of hiv-1 acquisition in vaccinees and the two pathways associated with a higher risk of hiv-1 acquisition both in vaccinees and placebo recipients. the normalized enrichment scores (nes) of those pathways are presented on the plot. an nes greater than 0 suggests that participants with higher expression of the genes in that pathway are less likely to be infected by hiv-1 while an nes below 0 corresponds to participants with higher expression of the genes in that pathway and more likely to acquire hiv-1. the size of the dots is proportional to the false-discovery rate (q value) of the enrichmentfull size imagethe association between the induction of the ifnγ response pathway and lower risk of hiv-1 acquisition was not observed for the placebo group suggesting that the ifnγ response pathway is associated with a vaccine-conferred reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition (fig. 3). these ifnγ response genes included genes involved in the maturation of the mhc class ii complex (ap2a1 coding for the ap2 vesicle, ctsa, ctsb, ctsd coding for cathepsins a, b, and d; supplementary data 7) and genes involved in mhc class ii antigen processing (lgmn, ifi30) suggesting that these genes are critical for the class ii mhc restricted env-specific response. activation of the irf7 innate antiviral program (ifih19, irf7; supplementary fig. 2) was also associated with vaccine-conferred protection of hiv-1 acquisition (supplementary fig. 2 and supplementary data 6). we also observed the enrichment of putative binding sites for irf7 in the promoter regions of genes associated with a reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition (supplementary data 6, 12/53 of ifnγ response genes identified in the transcriptomic analysis are also part of the geneset v$irf7_01. this geneset includes genes that have a putative irf7 binding site within ±2000 base pairs of their transcriptional starting sites), genes transcriptionally repressed in irf7 sirna transfection experiments12 and genes induced by the overexpression of irf713,14 (supplementary data 6). these results highlight the role of irf7 as a transcriptional regulator of the reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition conferred by the rv144 vaccine.while the ifnγ response pathway was associated with reduced risk of acquisition in vaccinees, the nf-κb and mtorc1 signaling pathways were associated with increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition in both vaccine and placebo recipients (fig. 3). genes implicated in nf-κb signaling that were associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition included genes of the nf-κb complex (nfkb1, rela, relb) and activators of the nf-κb complex (bmp2, ripk2) (supplementary fig. 3 and supplementary data 7). genes implicated in mtorc1 signaling that were associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition included regulators of the mtorc1 complex (cxcr4, ddit4, nampt, xbp1) and its downstream targets (cdkn1a15, slc2a316, tfrc17). these results suggest that induction of ifnγ response genes is a vaccine-induced correlate of reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition while induction of nf-κb related and mtorc1-related genes are vaccine-independent mechanisms associated with increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition.ifnγ pathway associated with hiv-specific antibodies and cd4sthe six antibody and cellular assays which were previously assessed for their association with hiv-1 risk in rv144 vaccinees2 as well as cell counts for 7 cell subsets measured by flow cytometry (fcm), 7 luminex markers, 6 intracellular cytokine staining (ics), and 31 mhc class ii alleles measurements4 were included in an integrative analysis (supplementary data 8). a projection-based approach that minimizes the technical effect specific to each dataset by generating a unique scale (i.e., projecting) for every dataset allowing to assess the correlation between different datasets was used for the integrative analysis18. this integrative analysis revealed that the ifnγ signaling pathway was significantly positively correlated to the frequency of env-specific cd4+ t cells (including ifnγ producing t cells) and to titters of igg against v1/v2, a described correlate of low risk of hiv-1 acquisition in rv144 vaccinees (supplementary fig. 4). the ifnγ signaling pathway was also associated (through env-specific cd4+ t cells) to the frequency of pdcs, the primary source of type i interferons (interferons α/β) in blood as well as to the pfs, another previously described correlate of low risk in rv144 vaccinees that integrates the cytokine response of cd4+ t cells in response to hiv-1 env. the integrative analysis highlighted the relevance of the pathway identified above as they show their association with previously identified correlates of risk that underlie the major effector pathways of the immune response (igg against v1/v2 and pfs).this integrative analysis also revealed that the nf-κb pathway was significantly correlated with a higher frequency of monocytes and with heightened levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il2 and il3 (supplementary fig. 4). to further investigate the association between the nf-κb pathway and specific cell subsets including monocytes, we performed a deconvolution19 (i.e., separation) of the pbmc gene expression profile into six major immune subsets (b cells, t cells, nk, monocytes, mdc, and pdc) using the frequencies of those subsets measured by fcm (see methods and supplementary fig. 5a). analysis of the deconvoluted gene-expression profiles revealed that genes of the nf-kb pathway were expressed at significantly higher levels in monocytes compared to the other five subsets (supplementary fig. 5b, wilcoxon rank-sum test: p = 1.64e−06), thereby supporting the results of the integrative analysis (supplementary fig. 4).the mtorc1 pathway is a marker of hiv-1 acquisitionto test if the ifnγ signaling pathway could be a novel marker of low infection risk in vaccinees, we built a logistic regression model combining gender, behavior risk and previously described correlates of risk (iga against env, igg against v1/v2, dqb1*06 allele, dpb1*13 allele, and pfs) to predict acquisition of hiv-1 among rv144 vaccinees. this model was then compared to one that included results from gene-expression profiling. the balanced accuracy of both models was assessed by tenfold cross-validation. the best model built without gene expression showed a balanced accuracy of 62.3%, while the best model that included results from gene expression had a balanced accuracy of 67.9% (fig. 4a). receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to compare these two models; no statistically significant gain in accuracy resulted from the addition of gene-expression results to previously described correlates (fig. 4b). a multivariate logistic regression was built using all the candidate markers of protection to assess their relative contribution to the prediction of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees (table 1). only the pfs, the interaction term iga:dqb1*06, the interaction term igg:dpb1*13 (i.e., association between igg level with hiv-1 acquisition separately for dpb1*13− and dpb1*13+ vaccinees) and mtorc1 signaling remained statistically significantly associated to hiv-1 acquisition in a multivariate model. the ifnγ pathway identified by the transcriptional profiling (univariate analysis: odd ratio = 0.883 p = 0.00837; supplementary table 6) did not bring an independent contribution to the prediction of the risk of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees (multivariate analysis: odd ratio = 0.974 p = 0.677; table 1). this analysis suggests that the ifnγ pathway identified by gene expression was likely confounded (i.e., bring similar predictive information) with the cellular (pfs) and serological/genetic (igg:dpb1*13) correlates of the rv144 vaccine-conferred low risk of hiv-1 acquisition (supplementary table 6).fig. 4prediction of the response does not improve by adding transcriptomic data. a logistic regression models were built to predict hiv infection status of rv144 vaccinees (142 vaccinees that were hiv negative at last follow-up and 30 vaccinees that acquired hiv). the accuracy of each model was assessed by tenfold cross-validation. the first model (left panel) included iga against v2, igg against v1/v2, and the polyfunctionality score (pfs) previously identified as markers of response to rv144 vaccine. the second model (right panel) included the same markers as the first model but with the addition of the three pathways associated with hiv status in the transcriptomic analysis (ifnγ response, mtorc1 signaling, and tnfα signaling via nf-κb). the balanced accuracy (acc) of each model is given on the plot. b corresponding roc curves based 10-fold cross-validation for the model without the three genesets and the model with the three genesets identified in the transcriptomic analysisfull size imagetable 1 univariate and multivariate analysis of markers of hiv-1 acquisition among vaccineesfull size tablewe then assessed whether the ifnγ pathway was confounded with igg:dpb1*13. thus, we stratified the rv144 vaccinees by the dpb1*13 allele and evaluated the association between the ifnγ pathway and igg antibodies binding to v1/v2. stratifying rv144 vaccinees by the dpb1*13 allele revealed that the ifnγ signaling pathway and igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 were positively correlated to each other only in dpb1*13+ vaccinees (fig. 5a, b and supplementary data 9–12); moreover, the association of ifnγ signaling pathway with low risk was more pronounced in dpb1*13+ vaccinees (fig. 5c). conversely, the ifnγ signaling pathway was not correlated to igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 nor hiv-1 acquisition in dpb1*13− vaccinees. a significant overlap of 38 genes was observed between ifnγ response genes correlated with igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 in dpb1*13+ vaccinees (103 ifnγ response genes) and ifnγ response genes negatively associated with hiv-1 acquisition (53 ifnγ genes; fisher’s exact test: p = 0.00367). those 38 genes included the transcription factor irf7 and its target genes known to block viral entry (xcl1) or prevent hiv-1 virion assembly in infected cells (ifitm3, isg15, mx2, trim26). several genes encoding components of the killing machinery required for adcc function, i.e., casp320, fas21, tnfsf1021 (supplementary data 12) were included among the genes that correlated with titers of igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 suggesting that adcc responses could correlate with the decreased rate of virus acquisition after vaccination. concomitantly, we observed within the irf7 signature the expression of genes that could be involved in dampening th1 cell development (il18bp) or in driving the response toward th2 cells (parp14). genes with a potent anti-inflammatory activity that can suppress global immune activation (serping1, ly6e) were also expressed in the protective transcriptomic signature. itgb7, an integrin that is expressed by t cells and nk cells known for homing the gut was included in the irf7 target genes that were associated to protection from simian immunodeficiency virus (hiv-like virus) acquisition22. while several of the 38 genes included in the irf7 signature were known to be regulated by ifnγ, 24 out of 38 were also ifnα stimulated genes (supplementary data 11). in vitro experiments performed on healthy blood samples confirmed that irf7 phosphorylation (measured by fcm) was induced by more than 1.5-fold upon treatment with interferons (ifnα, ifnβ, or ifnγ). interferon treatment rendered host cells on average eight times more resistant to in vitro hiv-1 infection (fig. 5d, e and supplementary fig. 6). these results show for the first time the possible contribution of innate antiviral immune responses to lower the risk of hiv-1 acquisition among rv144 vaccinees and similar to what was previously reported by haynes et al.2, they highlight the contribution of innate cellular functions (nk/adcc) as correlates of risk in rv144, suggesting that these innate immune functions may play an essential role as correlates of rv144 vaccine-protection.fig. 5mechanisms associated with a reduced

size imagethe ifnγ signaling pathway that correlated with pfs, a correlate of reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition distinct from igg antibodies against v1/v2, included a different set of genes with the transcription factor stat1 as their key regulator (supplementary fig. 7 and supplementary data 13–15). several genes involved in the upregulation of mhc class i (tap1, tapbp) and class ii antigen presentation (hla-drb1, hla-dma), the initial step in the priming of t cell responses, as well as genes involved in the development of helper t cell functions (il15, il15ra, il4r) were involved in the positive correlation observed between the stat1 target genes part of the ifnγ pathway and the pfs score (supplementary data 15).tnfα signaling via nf-κb (41 genes) and mtorc1 (39 genes) signaling pathways were not associated with previously identified correlates of the rv144 vaccine response. herein, we provide evidence that these two pathways were associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 acquisition both in placebo- and vaccine-recipients (fig. 6 and supplementary data 5). the nf-κb signaling pathway included markers of activated t cells and their survival (bcl2a1, il12b, tnfsf9), cell migration (efna1, cxcl2, ccl20) and induction of proinflammatory prostaglandins (ptgs2). the mtorc1 pathway, with bhlhe40 as the upstream transcription factor, included genes known to be important for hiv-1 entry into target cells (co-receptor for hiv-1 on cd4+ t cells cxcr4, slc2a1, ung) as well as genes involved in hiv replication (etf1, hmgcs1, pgm1). both mtorc1 and nf-κb pathways included genes that were positive regulators of cell cycle (ccdn1, ccng1), genes that can inhibit cell cycle progression and downstream of the immune suppressive tgf-beta signaling pathway (tgif1, ppp1r15a). these results suggest that controlling the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways trigger the development of protective vaccine responses.fig. 6mechanisms associated with

performed to assess the significance of the association between the transcriptomic data and hiv-1 acquisitionfull size imagediscussion transcriptional profiling of pbmcs from rv144 vaccinees stimulated with env peptides was characterized by the upregulated expression of genes associated with antigen presentation, maturation of mhc class ii complex, and genes endowed with antiviral functions; these genes and pathways were induced only in vaccinees that remained hiv-1 negative at their last follow up (control) compared to vaccinees that acquired hiv-1 (cases). induction of these pathways was not observed in placebo recipients or in the absence of stimulation with env peptides indicating that the vaccine triggered those pathways. ex vivo experiments showed that irf7 (a key regulator of an antiviral innate immune response) associated with low risk in vaccinees, was expressed by t cells. expression of irf7, and more importantly genes with an antiviral activity that are regulated by irf7 (xcl1, ifitm3, isg15, mx2, trim26), in t cells can render these cells less susceptible to hiv-1 infection23,24,25,26,27,28. these results provide a mechanism whereby cd4+ t cells from subjects immunized with the rv144 vaccine will mount an env specific type ii interferon (interferon γ) response that could, in turn, trigger the expression of these antiviral genes (e.g., xcl1, ifitm3, isg15, mx2, trim26), thereby rendering these cells and bystander cells resistant to hiv-1 infection. attenuated viruses which are all known to be very efficacious vaccines (yf17d, measles, smallpox) are known to trigger these innate antiviral immune response pathways29,30.integration of gene expression, antibody responses, and ics datasets revealed that the ifnγ pathway correlated with igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 (explaining 5% of the variance of the ifnγ pathway) and with cytokine production by env-specific cd4+ t cells (explaining 8% of the variance of the ifnγ pathway). herein, we show that different signatures can independently predict immunogenicity of the vaccine (stat1 regulated genes) and low risk of acquisition (irf7 target genes) confirming the nonredundant roles of igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 and t cells polyfunctionality. indeed, antiviral genes regulated by irf7 were significantly associated with igg response while stat1-target genes implicated in antigen presentation via mhc class i and class ii were specifically correlated with the pfs. the irf7 signature was enriched in ifnα-stimulated genes (24/38 genes) compared to the stat1 signature (34/97 genes, χ2 test: p = 0.00555) suggesting that different stimuli triggered the irf7 and the stat1 gene signatures; type i interferons stimulated the irf7 gene signature, while type ii interferons could specifically induce the stat1 gene signature. in support of our observations, knock out of irf7 in murine models did not abrogate cd4+ t cell responses31 while it led to enhanced viral replication. in contrast, knock out of the stat1 gene in mice did abrogate antigen-specific cd4+ t cell responses. in line with these reports, stat1 regulated genes were specifically correlated to the heightened polyfunctional cd4+ t cell response linked to low risk in rv144 vaccinees and not to a general “non-protective” t-cell response (e.g., monofunctional cd4+ t cells that can secrete only one cytokine). the irf7 signature was specifically correlated to an igg response linked to low risk in rv144 vaccinees and was not correlated to other “non-protective” antibody markers such as igg response to non-v1/v2 epitopes. further evidence suggests that both irf7 and stat1 activation are required for the development of the protective immune response also supported by the fact that knock-out of stat1 and induction of irf7 is lethal in virally infected animal models as it leads to an uncontrolled cytokine storm32. our data shows that the antiviral innate immune response and the hiv specific cd4+ t-cell response are two independent correlates of low risk of hiv-1 acquisition.the irf7 antiviral transcriptomic program and the igg antibodies binding to v1/v2 were heightened in vaccinees that express dpb1*13 allele. this association may result from a t-cell response to specific t-cell epitopes present in env antigen and restricted by mhc class ii of dpb1*13. the protective role of dpb1*13 could also be attributed to the poor iga responses previously shown to occur in dpb1*13 + subjects33. iga antibodies compete with igg antibodies for binding to hiv-1 env and thus abrogate adcc in vaccinees6. igg responses have been shown to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc6. type i interferon (including irf7) induces the expression of fcgr that triggers adcc; the latter has been suggested to be a mechanism of rv144 vaccine-mediated protection2. binding of igg antibodies (specific for v1/v2) to fcgr will trigger adcc and will induce irf7 and type i interferons34. gene-expression analysis confirmed the potential role of adcc in response to the rv144 vaccine since several genes implicated in adcc are induced by the vaccine; they include markers of nk cells (cd48, kir2dl1, kir3dl1, kir3dl2, nkg2c, fcgr3a) as well as effector molecules of adcc (ncr1, ncr2, fas, gzmb, prf1, tnfsf10); of note only fcgr3a, tnfsf10 were associated with a reduced risk of hiv-1 acquisition. in addition, irf7-induced genes important for cell trafficking (e.g., cxcl10 and itgb7) may promote migration of effector cells to the mucosal sites where hiv-1 infection will occur. of note, itgb7 was confirmed in an animal model as a correlate of protection of an rv144-like vaccine22.integration of all these datasets suggests a model whereby alvac vector, used to prime rv144 vaccinees and know to be able to infect dendritic cells, trigger pdcs to produce type i interferons as alvac interact the innate sensor sting35. type i interferon will upregulate antiviral genes in bystanders cells including env-specific activated cd4 t cells. these cells now can provide help to b cells to produce igg and to other cd4 t cells. this model can be deduced only by integrating multiple omics and will be validated in subsequent clinical trials.our analysis indicated that genes downstream of the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-κb as well as genes downstream of mtorc1 that are required for hiv-1 life-cycle (cxcr4, etf136) were associated with the risk of hiv-1 acquisition; those associations were observed in the placebo and vaccine arms of the study and thus were independent of vaccination. hence, participants expressing the mtorc1 and nf-κb signatures did not benefit from the rv144 vaccine. moreover, those results are not supportive of vaccine-related enhancement of hiv-1 acquisition in rv144 vaccinees.both the integrative analysis between gene expression and frequency of cells measured by fcm as well as in the deconvolution of the gene expression confirmed monocytes as the cellular subset that expressed high levels of nf-κb and its downstream targets. activated monocytes that express high levels of nf-κb genes would trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as il2 and il3 that can enhance the survival of activated t cells thereby providing hiv-1 with potential target cells to infect and lead to hiv-1 acquisition susceptibility. moreover, the association with increased acquisition of genes that regulate tgfβ signaling or genes that are downstream of the antiproliferative cytokine tgfβ could result from the immunosuppressive activity of tgfβ on the development of protective hiv-1 specific cd4+ or cd8+t cell responses36. tgfβ is also known to regulate iga class switch; iga against env was shown to be associated with a higher risk of hiv-1 acquisition2.in addition, host proteins required for hiv-1 life cycle downstream of mtorc1 signaling pathways (cxcr4, etf137) were elevated in both placebo recipients and vaccinees. rapamycin, that downregulates mtorc1 pathway, could improve the effectiveness of the rv144 vaccine as it did enhance the response to flu vaccination in a cohort of elderly subjects38.our study highlights the important contributions of unbiased system biology approaches in defining mechanisms underlying vaccine-mediated protection. similar approaches could lead to the identification of host-related markers associated with vaccine-conferred protection by investigating prevaccination gene-expression profiling of participants receiving the rv144 vaccine. moreover, the contribution of the mucosal immune response needs to be assessed since we have previously shown using similar unbiased approaches that integrate mucosal and systemic immune responses can inform us on mechanisms leading to vaccine-conferred protection22. differential gene expression could also result from polymorphisms in the coding and regulatory regions of those genes, alternative splicing, chromatin accessibility or noncoding rna expression39. the platform used in this study, microarrays, does not provide us with the ability to investigate all those regulatory elements. further studies using such high-dimensional data types would further complement the mechanistic insights identified in this study that lead to the vaccine-conferred protection by the rv144 vaccine. finally, follow-up studies using in vitro experiments and animal models are required to confirm the functional/mechanistic contribution of the aforementioned pathways.in conclusion , we have shown that the establishment of a productive hiv-1 infection in participants depends on the balance between innate antiviral and proinflammatory responses. the proinflammatory responses mediated by mtorc1 and nf-κb signaling can lead to the activation and proliferation of hiv-1 target cells. immune modulators that boost innate antiviral responses and suppress proinflammatory detrimental immune responses may decrease the risk of hiv-1 infection or replication. the hvtn 702 trial, the follow-up efficacy trial of a pox-protein vaccine regimen initiated in south africa in q4 2016, will allow us to evaluate and confirm the mechanisms identified in this study as being associated with the rv144 correlates.methodsstudy designfifty participants of the rv144 clinical trial were part of the transcriptomic pilot study, randomly sampled within each (gender × treatment arm) strata (50% for each gender, 80% vaccine recipients) among subjects completing follow-up hiv negative. this ensured that baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in the transcriptomic pilot study were similar to the original rv144 cohort (16,402 participants) except for greater proportions of vaccinees and participants that completed the trial protocol in the transcriptomic pilot study cohort (supplementary table 1). separately, 183 participants of the rv144 clinical trial were selected for the transcriptomic case/control study. baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in the transcriptomic case/control study were similar to the original rv144 cohort (16,402 participants) except for greater proportions of vaccinees, participants that completed the trial protocol and participants that acquired hiv-1 in the transcriptomic pilot study cohort (supplementary table 3). no imbalance was observed in term of clinicopathological characteristics between the vaccinees and placebo recipients included in the transcriptomic pilot study cohort (supplementary table 2) or the transcriptomic case/control study cohort (supplementary table 4). the rv144 trial protocol was reviewed by the ethics committees of the ministry of public health, the royal thai army, mahidol university, and the human subjects research review board of the u.s. army medical research and materiel command. all participants gave their informed consent. written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers.vaccinealvac-hiv (vcp1521) is a recombinant canarypox genetically engineered to express hiv-1 gag and pro (subtype b, lai strain) and crf01_ae (subtype e) hiv-1 gp120 (92th023) linked to the transmembrane 3 anchoring portion of gp41 (lai). aidsvax b/e is an hiv gp120 envelope glycoprotein vaccine containing a subtype e envelope from the hiv-1 strain a244 (cm244) and a subtype b envelope from the hiv-1 mn. the envelope glycoproteins, 300 µg of each, are co-formulated with 600 µg of alum adjuvant. alvac-hiv placebo consisted of virus stabilizer and freeze-drying medium in 1 ml sodium chloride. aidsvax placebo was 600 µg alum adjuvant.primary endpointhiv infection was monitored every 6 months, from month 6 to month 36 after the initial immunization. hiv infection established from repeated positive results on enzyme immunoassay and western blots, with two confirmatory hiv nucleic acid tests: the amplicor hiv monitor (version 1.5) assay (roche) in thailand and the procleix hiv discriminatory assay (novartis) in the united states. correlates analyses defined the primary endpoint as the diagnosis of hiv-1 infection any time after the month six visit postinitial immunization.transcriptomic analysispbmc samples taken preimmunization and 2 weeks (window: −2 to +14 days) after the last immunization, were either stimulated in vitro for 15 h with env peptides or with the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide). the env peptides consisted of 15 amino acids spanning the env 92th023 sequence expressed in vcp1521 and overlapping by 11 amino acids (biosynthesis, lewisville, tx) were combined into one pool at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml per peptide, and used to stimulate 106 pbmc ex vivo; as further detailed in haynes et al.2. the transcriptomic profile of the stimulated pbmc was assessed using illumina human ht-12 beadchips. rna was isolated using the rneasy micro kit (qiagen) and the quantity and quality of the rna were confirmed using a nanodrop 2000c (thermo fisher scientific) and an experion electrophoresis system. samples (50 ng) were amplified using illumina totalprep rna amplification kits (ambion). the microarray analysis was conducted using 750 ng of biotinylated complementary rna hybridized to human ht-12 version 4 beadchips (illumina) at 58 °c for 20 h. the chips were scanned using illumina’s iscan and quantified using genome studio (illumina).raw beadchips intensities were quantile-normalized and log2-transformed. the limma framework was used to fit linear regression model with the log2 gene expression as dependent variable and the groups of interest (vaccination group, hiv-1 infection status, or antibody response) as independent variables in order to identify genes differentially expressed between vaccination group (vaccine or placebo), hiv-1 infection status (control versus case) or genes correlated to antibody response (igg antibodies binding to v1/v2). a moderated t test was used to assess the statistical significance of the association between gene expression and the groups of interest. benjamini and hochberg correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing.genecards40, reactome41, generif42, and literome43 were used to annotate the function of genes. the hiv-1 host factors were obtained from the ncbi hiv-1 interaction database44.gsea was used to identify pathways modulated after env stimulation and/or associated with hiv-1 acquisition45. in gsea, the most varying probe across samples was used as representative of redundant probes annotated to the same gene. the gene list ranked by limma moderated t-statistic were used as input for the gsea analysis. the pathways (i.e., genesets) database used for all gsea analysis were the molecular signatures database (version 5.1) hallmark genesets46, canonical pathways (module c2.cp), transcription factor targets (module c3.tft), and blood cells markers47. the gsea java desktop program was downloaded from “http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp [http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp]” and the default parameters of gsea preranked module (number of permutations: 1000; enrichment statistic: weighted; seed for permutation: 101, 15 ≤ gene set size ≤ 500) were applied for analyses. putative transcription factor binding sites were identified in the regulatory region of genes associated with hiv-1 acquisition using homer version 4.9 using default parameters48.slea was used following gsea analysis to investigate the enrichment of pathways in the different samples49. briefly, the expression of all the genes in a specific pathway was averaged across samples and compared to the average expression of 1000 randomly generated genesets of the same size. the resulting z-score is then used to reflect the overall perturbation of a pathway in a sample.intracellular cytokine stainingpbmc were plated in a 96-well plate (106 cells per well). pbmc stimulation was performed in 10% fbs/rpmi media in the presence of 1 μg/ml anti-cd28 and anti-cd49d and brefeldin a (bd biosciences, san diego, ca) and stimulated with hiv peptides (new england peptide, gardner, ma) of 15-mer overlapping by 11 amino acids representing hiv subtype e-env (th023; 162 peptides) and hiv subtype b-gag (lai; 120 peptides). pbmc supplemented with dmso was used as a negative control. after 6 h of stimulation at 37 °c, 5% co2 edta (20 mm, sigma) was added and incubated for 15 min. subsequently, pbmc were fixed and permeabilized using facs lysing solution and facs permeabilizing solution 2 (bd) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the following antibodies were added for 60 min at room temperature in the dark: cd4-fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc), cd3-allophycocyanin (apc), ifnγ-phycoerythrin (pe), il-2-phycoerythrin (pe), and cd8-percp-cy5.5 (all bd biosciences). pbmc were washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. the analysis was performed using a facscalibur flow cytometer (bd immunocytometry systems). ics data were provided to us by the trial investigators in either an ics-positivity score (call) format and aggregate value format2. ics analytes included cd154, ifnγ, il-4, il-2, il-17α, and tnfα.multiplex cytokine bead arraycryopreserved pbmc were thawed and rested overnight. totally, 5 × 105 pbmc each were stimulated with env 92th023 peptides at 37 °c and 0.5% dmso served as negative control. after 48 h, supernatants were harvested and frozen at −80 °c until analysis. analyte concentrations were measured using a milliplex map human cytokine/chemokine—custom-12-plex kit (millipore, billerica, ma) following instructions provided by the manufacturer. all samples were acquired on a luminex 200 instrument (millipore) and data analyses were performed using masterplex software. multiplex cytokine (luminex) data were provided to us by the trial investigators as normalized values (mean of 0, a standard deviation of 1)2. luminex analytes included gm-csf, ifnγ, il-2, il-3, il-4, il-5, il-9, il-10, il-13, mip1β, tnfα, and tnfβ.fcm phenotyping panelsamples were stained for extracellular markers for facs analysis following the manufacturer’s recommendations (becton dickinson cytofix/cytoperm kit). samples were surface stained with the following antibodies to distinguish cell subsets: cd11c (pe-cy5), cd14 (fitc), hla-dr (allophycocyanin-cy7), cd3 (qdot 800), cd19 (qdot 605), and cd123 (brilliant violet). they were acquired using a becton dickinson lsr ii flow cytometer and analyzed using flowjo (treestar). antibodies were from becton dickinson unless otherwise stated. the fcm phenotyping data were provided to us by the trial investigators in raw cell counts. the cell surface markers used to identify each subset is provided in supplementary data 8.ex vivo stimulation and in vitro hiv-1 infectability assayscryopreserved or fresh isolated pbmc samples from healthy donors (n = 10) were thaw and enriched for cd4 memory t cells by negative selection, according to manufacturer’s protocol, with the easysep human cd4 memory t cell enrichment kit (stemcell technologies, 10157). isolated cd4 memory t cells were cultured at concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml with logarithmic increasing concentrations of ifnα [0.02, 200 ng/ml], ifnβ [0.002, 200 ng/ml], ifnγ [0.005, 50 ng/ml] or left unstimulated. the efficacy of the cytokines to induce irf7 and stat1 phosphorylation was evaluated in 100,000 cells from 5 donors at the lowest and the highest concentration of the respective cytokines by flow cytometry. the remaining cells were kept in culture for 18 h. following incubation, hiv-1 infection through spinoculation with 89.6 viral supernatant (nih aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih: p89.6 from ronald g. collman, md) was performed at 200 ng/ml p24/million cd4+ t cells in the presence of 4 µg/ml polybrene (sigma, h9268), at 2500 rpm for approximately 2.5 h at 30 °c. after spinoculation, viral supernatants were removed and infected cells were cultured at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in crpmi supplemented with 30 iu/ml il-2 (r&d systems, 202-il), 5 µm saquinavir (nih aids reagent program, 4658) and the respective cytokines at 37 °c, 5% co2 for three days. on day 4, hiv-1 p24 levels were evaluated by fcm on cd4-negative cells. the data are represented as the frequency of infected p24+ cells, hiv-1 per cell level (median of fluorescence intensity) per condition normalized by unstimulated cells. a paired wilcoxon-rank sum was used to compared the frequencies/intensities of cells after interferon stimulation to the unstimulated condition.integrative analysisa projection-based approach implemented in the r package mixomics was adopted to assess the correlations between gene-expression and other data types (ics, luminex and fcm). for each pair of data type, a sparse-least square regression was used to project the first element of the pair onto the second element of the pair. once the two data types are projected on the same scale, the pearson correlation between the features of the two data types was calculated. to assess the probability of obtaining a pearson correlation equal to or greater than the one observed, we derived a p value based on the distribution of the pearson correlations calculated between all pair of features of the two data types (i.e., the statistical universe). pearson correlations corresponding to a p value cutoff of 0.05 were considered significant.deconvolution of blood transcriptomethe function lsfit of the r package cellmix19 was used to model the pbmc gene expression measures across samples as the function of contributions of immune subset-specific gene expression weighted by the corresponding cell frequencies of those subsets measured by fcm. to verify that the deconvolution was successful, we investigated the gene expression of the cell surface markers used for cell-sorting. we observed a concordant expression of several protein markers specifically expressed at the surface of those subsets (supplementary fig. 5a).to obtain immune subset-specific gene expression estimates for rv144 controls and cases, we applied linear regression separately to each group’s gene expression. the linear regression coefficient estimates are taken as surrogates for estimated cell type-specific average gene expression while a difference between these cell type-specific estimates was used as the level of gene expression change between the controls and cases in a given cell type.hiv-1 acquisition classifierslogistic regression models were built using the function glm of the r package stats. gender and behavior risk were included in all regressions as independent variables. hiv-1 acquisition, the dependent variable was coded as a binary variable while pfs, gene-expression pathways, iga and igg titers were coded as continuous variables. a wald test was used to test if the coefficients of regression are statistically different zero (i.e., null hypothesis being no association between a marker of interest and hiv-1 acquisition). the accuracy of each regression model was estimated by tenfold cross-validation. receiver operating characteristic curves and delong’s test was used to compare the accuracy of two regression models.statistical analysesstudent t test was used to test for the significance of pathway and antibody response while a non-parametric test, the wilcoxon rank-sum test, was used to test for difference in pathway expression between hiv-1 cases and controls. the benjamini and hochberg correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. for all gene expression analysis. a 5% cutoff on the probability of false positive (i.e., p value) was used as a statistical stringency for all analyses presented in this

High Abundance of genus Prevotella in the gut of perinatally HIV-infected children is associated with IP-10 levels despite therapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35877-4,Research,5 December 2018,yes,"perinatal hiv infection is characterized by faster hiv disease progression and higher initial rate of hiv replication compared to adults. while antiretroviral therapy (art) has greatly reduced hiv replication to undetectable levels, there is persistent elevated inflammation associated with hiv disease progression. alteration of gut microbiota is associated with increased inflammation in chronic adult hiv infection. here, we aim to study the gut microbiome and its role in inflammation in treated and untreated hiv-infected children. examination of fecal microbiota revealed that perinatally infected children living with hiv had significantly higher levels of genus prevotella that persisted despite art. these children also had higher levels of soluble cd14 (scd14), a marker of microbial translocation, and ip-10 despite therapy. the prevotella positively correlated with ip-10 levels in both treated and untreated hiv-infected children, while genus prevotella and species prevotella copri was inversely associated with cd4 count. relative abundance of genus prevotella and species prevotella copri showed positive correlation with scd14 in art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children. our study suggests that gut microbiota may serve as one of the driving forces behind the persistent inflammation in children despite art. reshaping of microbiota using probiotics may be recommended as an adjunctive therapy along with art.
introduction due to advent of antiretroviral therapy (art), hiv infection has now become a chronic disease that can be controlled with the ongoing treatment1. in addition, there has been 70% reduction in perinatal hiv infection between 2000 and 2015 as a result of introduction  of art in hiv-infected pregnant women (children and hiv, fact sheet, unaids, 2016). while art substantially reduces hiv viral replication in infected individuals, chronic complications such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, liver disease, kidney disease, neurocognitive impairment, and accelerated aging are being reported in higher frequency among horizontally hiv-infected adults2,3. during hiv infection, substantial cd4+t cells depletion occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. this loss is preferentially within th17 cells that help in mucosal defense and maintain the intestinal epithelial barrier4. the depletion of th17 cells in intestine has been reported to be associated with the disruption of epithelial barrier in hiv-infected individuals, leading to translocation of microbial products such as bacterial dna5 and lipopolysaccharides6 into systemic circulation. microbial translocation leads to immune activation and inflammation7 that persists despite suppressive art8,9,10,11 and may contribute to non-aids complications12,13.dysbiosis is associated with different inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd)14, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)15, diabetes16, obesity17,18, rheumatoid arthritis19, allergic disease20 and multiple sclerosis21,22. alteration in intestinal microbiota has also been reported in hiv-infected individuals23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. gori et al. showed increased prevalence of candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa with significantly lower abundance of beneficial bacteria like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the stool samples of treatment naïve adults with acute hiv infection compared to healthy controls24. during early hiv infection, high abundance of lactobacillales in the gut of untreated hiv-infected subjects is associated with increased cd4+ cell percentage, lower viral load and reduced microbial translocation that continued even after art35. later, several authors showed gut microbiota compositional changes during chronic hiv infection. they found significant increase in the relative abundance of genus prevotella and decreased bacteroides in the mucosal and fecal samples of adult hiv-infected subjects25,26,27,28,32,36. furthermore, hiv-associated taxa in adults strongly correlated with mucosal and systemic inflammation25,27,31,33.most of the previous work on the role of gut microbiota in hiv pathogenesis focused adult hiv-infected subjects. a recent study by bender et al. reported the gut microbiome differences in hiv exposed uninfected infants (heu) when compared to hiv unexposed uninfected children (huu). this difference in the gut microbiome of heu infants was associated with distinct breast milk oligosaccharides of hiv-infected mothers37. however, there are currently no reports on the role of gut microbiota in intestinal barrier integrity and microbial translocation in the setting of perinatal hiv-infection.children with hiv infection experience faster disease progression compared to adults, with death occurring among up to 50% of untreated children within 2 years of life38. this rapid progression is associated with high viral load and increased depletion of cd4+ lymphocytes in children than adults. perinatally hiv-infected children also showed viral mutation and poor drug adherence39. unlike adult hiv infection, perinatally hiv-infected children are exposed to hiv either in utero or during birth. this raises a possibility that perinatally hiv-infected children may either be tolerized and have least impact on gut microbiome or have distinct pattern of gut microbiota compared to hiv-infected adults. given the fact that the development of gut microbiota starts at birth and there is striking differences in hiv pathogenesis between adult and vertical hiv infection, we sought to study the composition and role of gut microbiota among treatment naïve and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children. in this study, we identified the difference in the fecal microbiota as a substitute to gut microbiota of perinatally hiv-infected children and age-matched uninfected controls. we carried out high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing to assess fecal microbiota and explored the relationship of unique fecal microbiota composition of treatment naïve and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children with systemic inflammation and microbial translocation.resultsperinatally hiv-infected children show a distinct pattern of gut microbiota compared to uninfected controlsto determine the composition of gut microbiota in the setting of perinatal hiv infection, we assessed fecal microbiota in perinatally hiv-infected children. we determined the relative abundance of fecal microbiota at the phylum, family, and genus level and compared their levels between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls. perinatally hiv-infected children showed distinct pattern of fecal microbiota compared to uninfected controls (fig. 1a–r). the three most predominant phyla accounting for >97% of the overall bacterial abundance in fecal samples of both hiv-infected children and uninfected controls were bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria. no significant difference was observed in the overall relative abundances at the phylum level between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls (p = 0.08) (fig. 1a). however, when relative abundance of individual phylum was compared between hiv-infected children and controls, bacteroidetes and spirochaetes were found to be significantly elevated (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0007, respectively) whereas firmicutes, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria were significantly lower (p = 0.002, p = 0.0007 and p = 0.03, respectively) in hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls (figs 1b–e and s1b). the relative abundance of the remaining phyla did not show any significant difference between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls (fig. s1a,c–e). on comparing the bacteria at the family and genus level, we observed overall relative abundances to be significantly different between hiv-infected children and uninfected controls (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively) (fig. 1f,l). then, we individually compared the relative abundance of top abundant bacterial families between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls and observed that the relative abundance of prevotellaceae was significantly higher (p = 0.0007), while bacteroidaceae (p = 0.0008), ruminococcaceae (p = 0.005), lachnospiraceae (p = 0.01), and rikenellaceae (p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in perinatally hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls (figs 1g–k, s2a–g). among the abundant genera, the relative abundance of prevotella and megasphaera were significantly increased (p = 0.0007, and p = 0.02, respectively), whereas that of bacteroides (p = 0.0008), faecalibacterium (p = 0.01), ruminococcus (p = 0.006) and haemophilus (p = 0.04) was significantly lower in hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls (fig. 1m–r). the relative abundance of remaining abundant families and genera did not show difference between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls (figs s2 and s3). the ratio of abundance of bacteroides to prevotella was significantly lower in perinatally hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls (p = 0.0008, fig. s5a). our data shows that perinatally hiv-infected children have distinct pattern of gut microbiota compared to uninfected controls. the median values of relative abundance of significantly distinct phyla, families, and genera between perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls are shown in table s1.figure 1(a) stacked bar plot depicting mean relative abundance of top nine abundant phyla in the fecal samples

(fig. 2g–k). we also found overall relative abundance to be significantly different at the genus level between uninfected controls and treatment naïve (p = 0.005) or art-suppressed hiv-infected children (p = 0.01) (fig. 2l). art did not show any effect on the relative abundance of prevotella and bacteroides. compared to uninfected controls, treatment naïve and art-suppressed hiv-infected children had significantly higher relative abundance of prevotella (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.02 respectively) and lower abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively) (fig. 2m,n). the relative abundance of megasphaera was significantly higher (p = 0.02) and ruminococcus (p = 0.0007) was significantly lower only in treatment naïve hiv-infected children compared to controls (fig. 2p,q). however, compared to treatment naïve hiv-infected children, the relative abundance of ruminococcus was significantly higher in art-suppressed children, suggesting the complete restoration of this genus by art (fig. 2q). we did not observe difference in the relative abundance of faecalibacterium (p = 0.06) and haemophilus (p = 0.1) in treatment naïve hiv-infected children compared to controls (fig. 2o,r). however, art-suppressed hiv-infected children had decreased faecalibacterium compared to controls (fig. 2o). our results suggest that the fecal microbiota of hiv-infected children did not completely get restored after art treatment. the median values of relative abundance of significantly distinct phyla, families, and genera among treatment naïve, art-suppressed hiv-infected children and uninfected controls are shown in table s2.figure 2(a) stacked bar plot depicting mean relative abundance of top nine abundant phyla n the fecal samples of hiv negative, on art and treatment naïve perinatally hiv-infected children. comparison of relative abundance of phyla (b) bacteroidetes (c) firmicutes, (d) actinobacteria and (e) spirochaetes across hiv negative, on art and treatment naïve perinatally hiv-infected children.

prevotella is indirectly associated with cd4 t cells in perinatally hiv-infected childrenas cd4 depletion is a hallmark of hiv disease progression, we sought to determine association of genera that were significantly differentially abundant in hiv-infected children with cd4 count. the genus prevotella was only found to be indirectly associated with cd4 count in all hiv-infected children (p = 0.007; r = −0.6) (figs 4d and 6c). the indirect association between prevotella and cd4 t cell count remained significant in treatment naïve and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children (fig. 4e,f). prevotella did not show any correlation with cd4 t cell count in uninfected controls (data not shown).increased abundance of prevotella copri in the gut of perinatally hiv-infected children despite artwe were intrigued by the increased relative abundance of prevotella in perinatally hiv-infected children despite suppressive therapy and wanted to further characterize the genus prevotella to species level. at species level, we identified prevotella copri and prevotella stercorea. however, only the relative abundance of prevotella copri was found to be elevated in hiv-infected children compared to controls (p = 0.001) (fig. 5a). the relative abundance of prevotella copri was also significantly elevated in treatment naïve (p = 0.003) and art-suppressed hiv-infected children (p = 0.02) compared to uninfected controls, suggesting that art does not normalize the levels of prevotella copri in hiv-infected children (fig. 5b). additionally, the relative abundance of other abundant species bacteroides plebieus, bacteroides uniformis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the fecal sample of hiv-infected children was significantly decreased compared to controls (fig. s4) and remained lowered regardless of treatment. like genus prevotella, the relative abundance of p. copri also showed indirect association with cd4 t cells in overall and treatment naïve perinatally hiv-infected children (fig. 5c,d) however it failed to achieve level of significance in art-suppressed hiv-infected children (p = 0.08; fig. 5e). the median values for the relative abundance of prevotella copri in three groups are shown in table s2.figure 5dot plots representing relative abundance of prevotella copri in the fecal sample of (a) hiv positive and hiv negative children and (b) hiv negative, on art and treatment naïve perinatally hiv-infected children. the horizontal line and deviation in the dot plot represents median and interquartile range (iqr), respectively. mann-whitney u-test and kruskal-wallis one-way anova with dunn’s multiple comparison were performed for statistical analysis. the p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. correlation between relative abundance of prevotella copri and cd4 count in (c) hiv positive children (overall), (d) treatment naïve.

imageincreased levels of plasma scd14 in perinatally hiv-infected children despite artwe evaluated the level of microbial translocation marker, scd14 in the plasma of perinatally hiv-infected children. plasma level of scd14 was significantly elevated in perinatally hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls (fig. 7d). art could not normalize the level of scd14 in the plasma of treated hiv-infected children (fig. 7e). given that gut microbiota maintains gut epithelial barrier, we then evaluated whether significantly differentially abundant genera in hiv-infected children was associated with plasma level of scd14. we found haemophilus to be negatively associated with scd14 (r = −0.56, p = 0.01) (fig. 6c). relative abundance of prevotella and also prevotella copri directly correlated with plasma scd14 level in treated hiv-infected children (fig. 7f,g).discussion in this paper, we studied the fecal microbiota in treatment-naïve and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children, and compared them with that of uninfected controls. our study showed a unique pattern of fecal microbiota with elevated relative abundance of the genus prevotella and species prevotella copri in hiv-infected children that persisted during suppressive art. the genus prevotella was directly associated with soluble ip-10 and inversely correlated with cd4 count despite art. the genus prevotella and species prevotella copri positively correlated with scd14, a marker of microbial translocation, in art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children implying that prevotella may potentially be involved in persistent inflammation in perinatally hiv-infected children during therapy.alteration in the overall gut microbial diversity during hiv infection in adults currently remains controversial. some studies reported gut microbiota to be less diverse in untreated hiv-infected adults28,29,40,41 or the diversity to be decreased after art28,36, while others found no alteration in the diversity of gut microbiota26,27,31,33,34. in our study, we found decreased α-diversity in the fecal microbiota of hiv-infected children despite therapy. this discrepancy among previous studies could be due to different ethnicity, age, different stage of hiv infection of enrolled hiv-infected subjects, selection of sample type, use of antibiotics by study participants or different technologies used to study gut microbiota composition. perinatally hiv-infected children and uninfected controls participated in our study had preserved cd4 count and shared similar geographical region and dietary habits. as antibiotics alter gut microbiota composition profoundly42, we only included children who were not on antibiotics within last one month of sample collection. similar to studies on hiv-infected adults, beta diversity indices such as pca showed composition of fecal microbiota in most of the perinatally hiv-infected children to be different from uninfected controls. moreover, most of the treated hiv-infected children were clustered with treatment naïve hiv-infected children suggesting similar pattern of gut microbiota in treated and untreated perinatally hiv-infected children. thus, despite successful viral suppression, art could not completely restore fecal microbiota in children with hiv.untreated hiv-infected children had increased relative abundance of bacteroidetes and decreased firmicutes whereas studies on hiv-infected adults reported decreased firmicutes with no difference in bacteroidetes abundance compared to controls25,29,30,43. we did not observe any difference in the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria in perinatally hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls, which is in contrast to a recent study by dinh et al. who showed significantly enriched relative abundance of proteobacteria in the fecal samples of adults living with hiv31. the variations in the relative abundance of proteobacteria in hiv-infected subjects have been observed across studies. some previous studies that evaluated intestinal mucosal biopsies showed increased relative abundance of proteobacteria in hiv-positive patients25,28, whereas other failed to observe any difference in the fecal and rectal sponge samples of hiv-positive patients compared to healthy controls26,29.our observations of increased relative abundance of prevotellaceae and decreased relative abundance of bacteroidaceae and rikenellaceae in untreated hiv-infected children are in agreement with the previous findings in hiv-infected adults25,27,36. similar to hiv-infected adults25,26,27,28,32, we also observed significantly increased relative abundance of prevotella with decreased abundance of bacteroides in perinatally hiv-infected children. increase in gut prevotella has been reported in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis44,45 and metabolic syndrome46. recent studies have shown that the high abundance of prevotella in hiv-infected individuals is attributed to their sexual behavior rather than to the disease itself32,47. however, in our study prior sexual behavior does not have any relevance because the study is focussed on perinatally hiv-infected children who have either not reached or just reached an early stage of puberty. a study by dillon et al. showed positive correlation of relative abundance of prevotella with mucosal cd4+ and cd8+ t cell activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing mucosal cd4+ and cd8+ t cells25 however, ling et al. did not find any significant correlation between prevotella abundance and systemic inflammatory cytokines27 in hiv-infected adults. this suggests that the potential inflammatory role of prevotella is only confined to the local gut immune system. in contrast to the previous study in adults25,27, we found that relative abundance of prevotella was indirectly associated with peripheral cd4 count and directly associated with mdc in perinatally hiv-infected children. mdc has emerged as novel modulator of lung inflammation in mice48 and an inflammatory marker to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis in children and infants49. more recently, the increased levels of mdc in hiv-infected adults have also been reported50. this suggests the potential inflammatory role of mdc in hiv-infected children, however the level of mdc normalizes after initiation of art. interestingly, absolute abundance of prevotella was found to be directly associated with soluble ip-10 in untreated and art-experienced perinatally hiv-infected children. our results indicate that prevotella outgrowth (represented by increase in the absolute number of prevotella), rather than prevotella evenness may drive the production of ip-10.level of ip-10 has been shown to be elevated in many viral infections, including acute west nile virus51, acute and chronic hcv52,53 and severe influenza infection54,55 suggesting the role of this chemokine in immune response to viral infection. elevated ip-10 has been reported during acute and chronic hiv infection52,56,57,58,59. consistent with previous studies on hiv-infected adults60,61, art could not normalise the plasma level of ip-10 in perinatally hiv-infected children to that of uninfected controls. previous studies on acute and chronic hiv infection in adults showed positive correlation of ip-10 with viral load57,59 and negatively with cd4 count56, thus proposed ip-10 to be the marker of disease progression. however, we failed to find direct correlation between ip-10 and hiv viral load in perinatally hiv-infected children, possibly because of limited sample size.infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) with hiv-1 has been shown to stimulate the production of gro-α chemokine in-vitro. this chemokine in turn prompt hiv replication in macrophages and lymphocytes, thereby contributing to hiv pathogenesis62. our observation of elevated level of gro in untreated hiv-infected children might be due to viral replication.elevated scd14, a marker of microbial translocation is associated with increased mortality among hiv-infected individuals63 and also scd14 level in hiv-infected mothers have reported to be directly associated with risk of mother to child transmission64. consistent with prior findings65,66,67,68, perinatally hiv-infected children had increased plasma level of scd14 compared to uninfected children, showing gut epithelial barrier disruption and microbial translocation that persists even after suppressive therapy. our study also showed positive correlation of scd14 with abundance of genus prevotella and prevotella copri in treated hiv-infected children. however the presence of virus appears to disrupt this correlation as seen in untreated hiv-infected children. this suggests that either hiv or other unknown factors driven by hiv viral load contribute to microbial translocation in untreated subjects. additional contributory factors to increased microbial translocation in untreated children are the decreased relative abundance of lachnospiracea and ruminococcacea families that include many butyrate-producing bacterial species that are essential for preserving the gut mucosal integrity69.ours is the first study to investigate the fecal microbiota composition of treatment naïve and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children that showed association of genus prevotella with ip-10 and scd14, a microbial translocation marker. these results suggest that prevotella is proinflammatory in nature that may augment the inflammation in perinatally hiv–infected children despite art, and may potentially promote chronic complications. our study has few limitations. first, in our cross sectional study fecal microbiota has been used as a proxy for gut microbiota. fecal microbiota only represents gut lumen microbiota and does not reflect mucosal-associated microbiota, which is important to consider as microbes on the gut mucosa can potentially interact with gut associated lymphoid tissue (galt). however fecal sample was only the realistic sample for non-invasive study. second, though we showed impact of art on the fecal microbiota of hiv-infected children, the effect of individual antiretroviral drugs on fecal microbiota is not investigated in our study.in summary, our study found distinct gut microbiota composition in untreated and art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children compared to uninfected controls. they had higher abundance of prevotella and decreased bacteroides, and elevated levels of ip-10 that persists despite art. the higher abundance of prevotella may promote hiv pathogenesis as suggested by the negative association of prevotella with cd4 count. interestingly, the direct correlation between prevotella and ip-10 suggests that ip-10 may be regulated by gut microbiota and could potentially contribute to ongoing inflammation and t cell depletion. future studies to understand the mechanism of prevotella-driven inflammation may aid the development of therapeutic interventions that can reconstitute healthy gut microbiota and mitigate the level of inflammation in individuals living with hiv.methodsstudy populationstudy population included 29 perinatally hiv-1-infected children and 14 uninfected age matched controls. perinatal infection in the child was confirmed by the documentation of hiv infection within 1 year of life. among hiv-infected children, 15 children were on art for more than 6 months, whereas the other 14 children were not on art (treatment naïve). to study the gut microbiota, 11-treatment naïve and 8 art-suppressed perinatally hiv-infected children were included together with 14 uninfected controls for the high throughput sequencing of dna extracted from fecal sample. all treated hiv-infected children had undetectable plasma viral load (vl < 50 copies/ml). uninfected controls were matched for sex and age to hiv-infected children. the following criteria were used to exclude children: age more than 15 years old, use of antibiotics or probiotics within one month of sample collection, any medical history of intestinal inflammatory disorders, evidence of hepatitis b and c infection, and vaccination within 1 week of sample collection. all study participants belonged to

with errors in barcode or primer sequences, reads containing ambiguous bases and low quality sequences (reads with more than 10% quality threshold (qv) <20 phred score) along with a sliding window of 20 bp and a minimum length of 100 bp. according to barcodes, the high quality reads obtained were then assigned to samples. using uclust in qiime the high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (otus) with 97% sequence similarity. otus was used to analyze alpha diversity indices (shannon and simpson) using qiime. for pca, distance matrices were calculated using r. using greengenes reference databases, the taxonomies are assigned to the otus by uclust with a threshold of 90% sequence similarity. explicet software v2.8.5 was used to analyze otus and create

Single Cell Profiling Reveals PTEN Overexpression in Influenza-Specific B cells in Aging HIV-infected individuals on Anti-retroviral Therapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38906-y,Research,21 February 2019,yes,"memory b cells (mbc) respond to secondary antigen challenge to protect against infection and to boost immunity following vaccinations. despite effective treatment, chronic hiv infection disturbs mbcs by reducing numbers and altering functionality due to hyper-activation and increased apoptosis leading to suboptimal antibody responses against common infectious agents. we used single cell gene expression analysis to evaluate antigen-specific memory b cells in peripheral blood of virally-suppressed hiv-infected individuals and healthy controls stratified by serum h1n1 antibody response 3 weeks post-administration of the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. we used a fluorescent probe to isolate influenza h1n1-specific b cells and a multiplexed and targeted rt-pcr approach to measure expression levels of 96 genes involved in b cell activation and function. gene profiling revealed a 4-gene predictive signature containing the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (pi3k) inhibitor, pten, for identifying antigen-specific mbc from hiv-infected individuals compared to healthy controls. gene co-expression analysis showed that in addition to overexpression of pten, there was increased co-expression of type i interferon-associated genes with pten on single cell level in hiv compared to controls. this study highlights the persistent defects in mbc from hiv-infected individuals and points to the pi3k signaling pathway as a target for potential immune intervention.
introduction memory b cells (mbc) are an important component of the immune system which are maintained for long periods following induction by vaccination or infection. classically defined mbcs express class-switched, somatically hyper-mutated (shm) b cell receptors (bcr) following a germinal center (gc) reaction. mbc make up approximately 40% of all b cells in human adults and are a highly diverse population including igg+, iga+, and igm + isotype populations1. single mbc clones derived from a gc reaction can include more than one isotypic subset, demonstrating the functionally heterogeneous nature of these cells. further, circulating mbc can be delineated phenotypically by varying expression of the surface markers cd27 and cd21 whereby the majority of mbc are identified as resting memory (rm, cd27+ cd21+) followed by activated memory (am, cd27 + cd21 low/neg) and “tissue-like” memory (tlm, cd27 low/neg cd21 low/neg)2. the mbc compartment is critical for response to infection and is therefore a target for vaccine development against pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). broadly neutralizing anti-hiv antibodies (bnabs) have been isolated from hiv patients, following years of antigen exposure and many rounds of affinity maturation and shm. these isolated bnabs are under investigation for passive immune prophylaxis and therapeutic intervention3. during uncontrolled viremia, b cells producing anti-hiv antibodies have an altered phenotype compared to anti-influenza antibody producing b cells within individual patients4,5. although b cell defects, including cell turnover, hyper-activation and increased apoptosis are reverted with art initiation, mbc impairment remains6 due to chronic immune activation attributed to persistence of hiv antigen in lymph nodes and other sanctuary sites7,8,9,10.seasonal influenza vaccination is a useful modality for investigating immune response11,12. following vaccination, influenza-specific b cells expand, peaking around 7 days post-vaccination, and remain elevated up to one month post-vaccination13. increase in serum titers of anti-influenza antibodies is a measure of immune response to the vaccination. we have previously shown that influenza-specific responses in b cells14,15, t cells16,17,18, and the innate immune system19 are impaired in hiv-infected individuals in the context of viral suppression by art in both young and old (>60 years) individuals. however, these studies have largely been performed using bulk cell analysis from in vitro antigen-stimulated culture experiments. technological advances in single cell analysis allow for deeper interrogation of cellular states in cell populations with diverse functions, such as mbc. here, we used a single cell, targeted multiplex gene expression platform and predictive modeling to show that following in vivo stimulation with the seasonal flu vaccine, influenza-specific mbc exhibit divergent gene signatures in hiv-infected, art-suppressed individuals compared to age-matched healthy controls (hc). the resulting gene signature implicates pten-mediated inhibition of pi3k signaling pathway as a key player in persistent b cell dysfunction during hiv infection thereby providing a potential target for intervention in improving vaccine-induced antibody responses.resultsreduced memory b cell responses to influenza vaccination in hiv-infected individuals12 individuals were selected from a cohort of hiv-infected and healthy control adult volunteers (age range 60–76 yrs.) participating in an influenza vaccination study (florah cohort)15 to evaluate gene profiles of ex vivo h1n1-specific b cells (table 1). all hiv-infected participants were virologically suppressed on art. the h1n1 serum titers in this cohort are shown in supplemental fig. 1. vaccine responders were defined as individuals that showed at least 4-fold increases in h1n1 antibody titers 3 weeks post-vaccination. in the hc group 23/51 (45%) were classified as responders while in hiv group only 16/50 (32%) were h1n1 responders. this distribution of responders (r) and non-responders (nr) is similar to other influenza vaccination studies18,20. participants were excluded in this selection if they had high baseline titers against h1n1 (>1:80) and we selected an equal number of responders and non-responders to allow for comparison by serological response to vaccination. the fold increases in serum titer to h1n1 are shown (fig. 1a). hiv r exhibited a trend of higher fold increase compared to hc r although they exhibited an overall lower number of h1n1 specific memory b cells as determined by h1n1 igg elispot (fig. 1b). h1n1-specific b cells were identified using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and a fluorescently-tagged h1n1 probe21 (fig. 1c). hiv status did not affect the frequencies of cd20+ cells, igd negative cells, or h1n1-specific b cells (fig. 1d–f). vaccine response status also showed no relationships with b cell subset frequency measurements in the participants.table 1 study participants.full size tablefigure 1serologic and phenotypic characterization of ex vivo b cells after

pten is co-expressed with ifn-inducible genes in h1n1-specific cells from hivan advantage of single cell transcript analysis is the possibility to evaluate co-expression of multiple genes at a single cell level similar to flow cytometry analysis rather than averaging data from bulk cell preparations. given the strong overexpression of pten in h1n1-specific cells from hiv, we analyzed co-expression of pten with all other genes in the panel. this analysis revealed btk, ppp3ca, and tlr7 with positive correlations in hc participants only. pten correlated positively with 4 additional genes regardless of hiv status including apobec3g, igm, irak4, and stat5a suggesting that the latter genes are tightly co-regulated with pten expression (table 2). additional genes that were co-expressed with pten only in hiv included bst2, dock8, ifnar2, il10ra, and nfkb1. these results indicate that pten associated signaling pathways are perturbed in b cells from hiv-infected individuals despite viral suppression with cart.table 2 correlation of gene expression with pten in h1n1-specific b cells.full size tableig isotype expression in h1n1 specific b cellsto follow up on the pten: igm co-regulation, we analyzed ig isotype expression measured at the time of single cell sorting from total memory and h1n1-specific cells by flow cytometry (fig. 4a). h1n1-specific cells from both participant groups were dominated by igg expression, though in hiv 3/6 participants had a detectable igm + population whereas in hc only 1/6 had detectable igm memory cells (fig. 4b). in a separate experiment, pbmc from study participants were stimulated in vitro with h1n1 antigen for 5 days and surface expressed igm and igg were measured by flow cytometry. rm and tlm b cell subsets in hiv showed higher expression of igm-expressing cells compared to hc (fig. 4c). no significant difference in frequency of igg producing cells after antigen stimulation were observed (not shown).figure 4memory b cell ig isotype expression of h1n1-specific b cells.

pten drives a predictive signature able to discriminate between h1n1-specific memory b cells from hiv and hcto explore the strength of the hiv-specific gene signature observed in h1n1-specific b cells we applied machine-learning analysis methods. we used 33 differentially expressed genes identified between subpopulations (figs 2a, 3d and s2) to build a machine-learning predictor to identify b cells from hiv infected individuals. first, lasso16,24, a variable selection regression model, was employed to avoid over-fitting the model due to co-expression of genes. we used four machine learning algorithms and cross-validation by 3-, 5-, and 10-fold to estimate the predictive accuracy for identifying a cell from either group. each algorithm resulted in auc values greater than 0.83 and the highest was 0.89 (fig. 5a and supplemental table s2). this analysis resulted in a 4-gene signature with high predictive accuracy (0.851) and precision (0.885) that included pten, il10ra, apobec3g, and tlr7 (fig. 5b).figure 5predictive modeling of h1n1-specific b cells. for classification of hiv vs hc, (a) receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve for two-class neural network showing prediction accuracy of 0.864. single cell gene expression data for 33 genes was split 2:1 for train: test.

in b cells from hiv-infected, cart-suppressed participants on their response to vaccination, we used machine learning to classify single cells into 4 groups by hiv status and serological response to the seasonal flu vaccine (hc r, hc nr, hiv r, and hiv nr). we used the same 33 differentially expressed genes identified between the subpopulations, including those identified from comparison between r and nr in each group separately (supplemental fig. s3). the test group was plotted using pls-da and showed distinct clustering of the 4 groups (fig. 5c). however, the predictive accuracy was reduced for the 4 group classification compared to the 2 group with an average of 0.62 for the auc. hc r showed the highest accuracy out of all 4 groups while hc nr showed the lowest (fig. 5d). the resulting signature included the same 4 genes from the hiv/hc classification model but included ppp3ca as an additional gene, thus clearly being dominated by the gene differences between hiv and hc rather than between r and nr (fig. 5e).discussion in this study we used single cell gene expression analysis to evaluate transcriptional variation that can influence antigen-specific memory b cell functionality in the context of vaccine-induced antibody responses and chronic hiv infection. the driving question was derived from the observation that current biomarkers of influenza vaccine response (i.e. serum titers) are not fully informative especially in populations with acquired immune deficiencies25. hence, novel correlates of functional memory b cell responses are needed. single cell analysis allowed us to obtain robust and significant data from a small number of individuals and cells which were otherwise phenotypically indistinguishable by flow cytometry-based cell surface protein measurements. although single cell rna-seq technology is becoming widely-accessible and more cost effective using a variety of instruments and commercially available reagents for library preparation, the multiplex targeted gene expression allows one to interrogate specific genes of interest. a limitation of whole transcriptome (i.e. rna-seq) applications with resting lymphocytes is the efficiency for detection of the relatively small amount of rna present in the cell (compared to cell lines for example) can be at or near the lower limit of detection for low-depth sequencing techniques. thus, the targeted approach allows for assessment of select gene expression without the cost of ultra-deep sequencing per cell.single cell gene expression data revealed overexpression of pten in h1n1-specific memory b cells from hiv-infected individuals. this is the first time pten has been directly connected with human b cell dysfunction outside of the cancer field where pten is a well-described tumor suppressor gene whose mutation or deletion plays a role in a variety of sporadic human cancers26. pten has been shown to dampen bcr responses through direct inhibition of pi3k in situations of self-reactivity27 and virus infection using murine models28. pi3k signaling along with bcr engagement is required to induce the activation of b cells and their maturation toward antibody secreting cells29. genetic mutations in pi3k can lead to primary immune deficiency such as the recently described activated pi3 kinase delta syndrome, which leaves patients susceptible to recurrent respiratory tract infections30. our results suggest that pten over-expression is experienced globally by antigen-specific memory b cells during hiv infection rather than an isolated effect on hiv-specific immunity due to chronic antigenic stimulus as would have been predicted by previous studies in mice28. acute viral infection often leads to polyclonal b cell activation, therefore suppression of the humoral immune system via pi3k inhibition during this period could be a host mechanism to prevent bystander activation of self-reactive b cells. the molecular mechanisms governing pten overexpression in h1n1-specific b cells from this study are unknown, however positive regulators of pten gene expression include early growth response protein-1 (egr-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (ppar-γ), tumor protein 53 (p53), and human sprout homolog 2 (spry2)31. interestingly, egr-1 is a transcription factor broadly involved in cell survival and was identified as an upstream regulator in pathway analysis of degs between hiv and hc (fig. 2c), and thus may be responsible for pten expression observed. bcl6 was also identified as a likely regulator of the transcriptional differences between hiv and hc h1n1-specific single cells. bcl6 is expressed at high levels in germinal center b and t follicular helper cells32. in b cells, cell migration and differentiation from mature b cells into plasma cells is controlled by the switch from bcl6 driven transcriptional program to the antagonistic blimp1 program33.single cell gene co-expression analysis revealed that pten expression in h1n1-specific b cells positively correlated with igm gene expression (table 2). we also noted more participants with detectable igm-expressing h1n1-specific b cells in hiv infected individuals. the presence of igm memory in response to influenza vaccination in hiv-infected individuals might explain the discrepancy between high serum titers against h1n1 but reduced igg elispot results observed in the hiv-infected vaccine responders since the hai reaction used to quantify serum titers cannot distinguish between ig isotypes. igm-secreting mbc share many similarities with igg-secreting mbc including accumulation with age and the presence of bcl6 mutations due to co-expression with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) during a gc reaction34. however, the function of igm  memory remains controversial; some argue that igm mbc re-enter gc upon secondary re-challenge and igg mbc preferentially differentiate into antibody secreting plasma cells35 while other studies have shown that igm mbc are early and potent responders to antigen re-challenge resulting in robust antibody secretion in response to malaria36. the impact of influenza-specific igm memory cells on overall immunity against influenza infection is not yet understood though the observed increase in this population in hiv participants in this study suggests they may play a negative or compensatory role in hiv-infected individuals. interestingly, co-expression analysis in this study showed associations between the expression of pten in h1n1-specific memory b cells in hiv with type i interferon-associated genes such as bst2 (tetherin) and ifnar2 indicating the possibility that pten over-expression could be linked to reduced functional antibody responses in these cells via the type i interferon response pathway.modeling the four participant groups using single cell gene expression data allowed us to appreciate the functional gap between hc responders and hiv responders, and gene profiles associated with non-responders were equally divergent between hc and hiv. these data indicate that despite the presence of art, the alterations induced by hiv chronic infection on b cell antigen-specific responses persist and are of sufficient magnitude that necessitates separate analysis of hiv individuals from their healthy peers. other studies addressing the effects of hiv on b cell function during art have shown persistent defects in the form of reduced numbers of mbc and altered expression of cell surface markers related to activation and apoptosis37,38. in this study when hiv infected individuals were analyzed separately to compare r and nr, b and t lymphocyte associated (btla) expression was found to be higher in hiv nr compared to r, whereas all other degs showed higher expression in r (fig. s4). elevated btla suggests a role for immune regulatory mechanisms in inhibiting vaccine-induced antibody responses, similar to what has been observed in t cells with pd-1 and other immune checkpoint molecules during immune exhaustion39.the predictive signature for identifying h1n1-specific b cells from hiv-infected individuals was small containing only 4 genes, including pten, il10ra, apobec3g, and tlr7. the role of il10 in b cells is thought to be regulatory, as it is for t cells and other components of the immune system, and it has also been shown to promote igm production and suppress apoptosis40. apobec3g is a host restriction factor that plays an important role by interfering with reverse transcription during hiv replication in cd4 t cells during hiv replication. it is expressed in other cell types including b cells where co-expression with aid can affect somatic hypermutation and antibody maturation41,42. the final gene in the predictive signature, tlr7 is an endosomal toll- like receptor recognizing ssrna, and in naïve b cells provides a third signal for activation. tlr7 ligation in b cells promotes class-switching to igg43. both apobec3g and tlr7 are induced by type i interferon, suggesting that the presence of an ongoing anti-viral response in the hiv-infected subjects is shaping the type of antibodies produced in response to vaccination. overall, this signature reinforces the concept that enhanced type i interferon signaling can lead to impairment in b cell maturation where pten seems to play a central role. further, this study provides a framework for analysis of antigen-specific cells using single cell gene expression analysis and provides insight into persistent defects in b cell-mediated immunity in the context of treated hiv infection and introduce potential targets of intervention to improve vaccine responses.methodshuman pbmc samplesstudy participants were enrolled in a prospective, open-label influenza vaccine study and were recruited from university of miami, jackson memorial, and va hospitals in miami, fl. participants were recruited during the 2014–15 flu season from two populations: (1) hiv-infected, art-treated individuals who demonstrated virus suppression (hiv rna <40 copies/ml) for at least 1 year prior to enrollment, and (2) hiv-uninfected healthy controls. peripheral blood was collected from participants at pre-vaccination (t0) and day 21 post-vaccination (t2) with influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types a and b (tiv). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and plasma were stored in liquid nitrogen and −80c freezers, respectively, until further experiments were performed.this study was approved by the institutional review boards of university of miami and miami veterans affairs medical center and was carried out in accordance with approved guidelines. voluntary signed informed consent was obtained from every participant prior to participating in the study.determination of b cell response to h1n1 vaccinationhemagluttination inhibition (hai) assayserum ab titers to h1n1 influenza strains were evaluated separately using an hai assay, which was performed as previously described (21). hai titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which hemagglutination was prevented.elispot assayh1n1-specific memory b cells (mbc) were measured from t2 by elispot assay as described14. for mbc enumeration, previously cryopreserved pbmc were thawed, rested, and stimulated with 5 µg/ml h1n1/09 vaccine antigen plus anti-cd28 mab (1 µg/ml), cpg (as a positive control) or unstimulated (as negative control) for 5 days at 37 °c. on day 5, cells were plated in wells coated with goat anti-human igg (2 µg/ml, jackson immunoresearch) at 100,000 cells/well for 4 hours at 37 °c and assayed for h1n1-specific igg. spots were read using immunospot software and plate reader (cellular technologies ltd). h1n1-specific igg results were normalized and graphed as proportion of the positive control.

(supplemental fig. s2). overall 96 cells and 36 genes were filtered out following quality control sanitation steps and differential gene expression analysis was subsequently performed to contrast transcriptional profiles of h1n1-specific b cells between hc and hiv-infected participants.pathway analysisdifferential gene expression data was loaded along with fold change and p-values for comparison between hiv and hc into ingenuity pathway analysis software. only direct relationships were included in the analysis using the ingenuity knowledge base (genes only) as the reference set. upstream regulator analysis predicts transcriptional regulators (tr) that can explain observed gene expression changes by measuring overlap between the dataset genes and the genes that are regulated by a tr using fisher’s exact test and generating the “p‐value of overlap”.identification of gene signatures with lasso, plsda and machine learningto select key features from 33 genes for classifying 4 groups (hc-nr, hc-r,hiv-nr,hiv-r), fit log2 transformed data to a multinomial logistic regression model via lasso penalty using r package “glmnet”. 10-fold cross-validation (cv) was applied and the value of regularization parameter lambda giving minimum mean cv error (lamdamin) was determined. the resulting model from lamdamin was further assessed by partial least square discriminant analysis (plsda) using r package “mixomics” to identify minimum signature of gene features useful for differentiating 4 groups. five genes identified by plsda with best classification ability for 4 groups were further assessed for their prediction ability by 4 machine learning algorithms (multiclass neural network, multiclass logistic regression, multiclass decision forest and multiclass decision jungle) using microsoft azure machine learning studio (https://studio.azureml.net/). cross-validation was performed by 3,5,10 folds. four genes for classification of 2 groups (hiv,hc) were further assessed for their prediction ability by 4 machine learning algorithms (two-class neural network, two-class logistic regression, two-class boosted decision tree and, two-class locally-deep support vector machine) using microsoft azure machine learning studio. cross-validation was performed by 3,5,10 folds.

Targeted editing of the PSIP1 gene encoding LEDGF/p75 protects cells against HIV infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38718-0,Research,20 February 2019,yes,"to fulfill a productive infection cycle the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) relies on host-cell factors. interference with these co-factors holds great promise in protecting cells against hiv infection. ledgf/p75, encoded by the psip1 gene, is used by the integrase (in) protein in the pre-integration complex of hiv to bind host-cell chromatin facilitating proviral integration. ledgf/p75 depletion results in defective hiv replication. however, as part of its cellular function ledgf/p75 tethers cellular proteins to the host-cell genome. we used site-specific editing of the psip1 locus using crispr/cas to target the aspartic acid residue in position 366 and mutated it to asparagine (d366n) to disrupt the interaction with hiv in but retain ledgf/p75 cellular function. the resulting cell lines demonstrated successful disruption of the ledgf/p75 hiv-in interface without affecting interaction with cellular binding partners. in line with ledgf/p75 depleted cells, d366n cells did not support hiv replication, in part due to decreased integration efficiency. in addition, we confirm the remaining integrated provirus is more silent. taken together, these results support the potential of site-directed crispr/cas9 mediated knock-in to render cells more resistant to hiv infection and provides an additional strategy to protect patient-derived t-cells against hiv-1 infection as part of cell-based therapy.
introduction acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) is a life-threatening acquired disorder resulting from an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and the subsequent progressive loss of cd4+ t cells1. over the years, hiv research has identified several druggable targets, resulting in potent drugs that have considerably improved survival and long-term clinical management of hiv-infected individuals. the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) allowed hiv replication to be suppressed to below detection level2. however, even with strict adherence to the therapeutic regimen, patients remain chronically infected since cart is unable to clear latent viral reservoirs and thus necessitate lifelong treatment3,4. efficacy of the regimen is strongly determined by the degree of compliance, but inevitably comes with a substantial financial cost and drug-related adverse effects such as drug-resistant escape mutants, cumulative toxicities, persistent immune dysfunction and accelerated aging phenomena. hence, persistent viral reservoirs represent the main barrier towards a cure for hiv.diminishing the latent reservoir and/or preventing de novo infection events are potential mechanisms by which a cure can be accomplished. to date hiv virus has only been eradicated in a single person, the ‘berlin patient’5. in this case, cure was achieved following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (hsc) transplantation from a donor homozygous for ccr5δ32, a natural ccr5 mutant that prevents entry of hiv-1 (r5 strains). the latter success has fueled interest to develop alternative treatment strategies and engineer patient-derived immune cells that lack host factors that are essential for hiv replication and pathogenesis to achieve a permanent cure6,7,8. this sole case of hiv cure underscores gene therapy as a promising route to cure hiv9,10,11. a wide variety of anti-hiv strategies has been tested in cell-culture and animal models, and some of them have progressed to clinical trials12. zinc finger nuclease (zfn)-mediated genomic disruption in autologous cd4+ t-cells of the ccr5 coding region resulted in efficient inhibition of hiv-1 infection13. in line, more recently a crispr/cas9 array platform was developed to ablate multiple hiv-1 host factors simultaneously, generating primary human t-cells refractory to hiv infection, underscoring the potential of genome editing for therapeutic application against hiv-1 infection14. an important consideration that emerged from the study was the notion of deleterious consequences of complete gene ablation in vivo15. a problem that can be resolved by engineering specific modifications within the hiv co-factors to disrupt the interaction with the virus while retaining their normal cellular function.a crucial step in the viral replication cycle is the efficient and stable integration within the host cell genome, which is catalyzed by the viral integrase (in) enzyme through the direct interaction with the host cell protein lens epithelial derived growth factor p75 (ledgf/p75), encoded by the psip1 gene on chromosome 9. ledgf/p75 is used as cofactor by all lentiviruses to tether the viral pre-integration complex (pic) to the host chromatin16,17,18, thus guiding the integration toward actively-transcribed regions of the genome19,20. ledgf/p75 is also an epigenetic reader consisting of an assembly of conserved chromatin interacting domains at the n-terminus and a protein binding c-terminus (fig. 1a). the n-terminal end consists of pwwp (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain responsible for recognition of methylated histone tails21, a nuclear localization signal (nls)22, two at hook-like motifs and three relatively charged regions (cr)23. in the c-terminal region, the integrase (in) binding domain (ibd; aa347–429) functions as a protein hub, which interacts with several cellular proteins and protein complexes, as well as the lentiviral in (fig. 1a)22,24,25. a shorter protein isoform resulting from alternative splicing, ledgf/p52, shares the n-terminal portion of the protein, but lacks the ibd and is not implicated in lentiviral replication.figure 1guide rna adjacent to the coding sequence d366 shows efficient disruption of the psip1 gene. (a) schematic representation of ledgf/p75 protein with indication of the epitope sites of respective antibodies used in western analysis. below the human psip1 locus on chromosome 9 is depicted showing the different exons as light grey boxes. ibd is underlined in green. (b) schematic of representing the location of the different grna that were used (red lines), grna1 close to d366 and two additional supporting grnas (grna_a, grna_b). d366 is shown in yellow. the expected pcr fragment sizes are indicated as well as the predicted deletions for the different grna combinations. below the targeted gdna sequence is shown. d366 is boxed in green, the pam site is shown in red and the landing site of grna1 is shown in blue.

(d) western blot analysis showing ledgf protein in a polyclonal hek293t population transfected with the indicated grna pairs. wild-type 293t cells (wt) are shown as control. (e) immunocytochemical staining of endogenous ledgf showing nuclear localization in wt and crispred polyclonal hek239t cells. phalloidin-stained f-actin in white is shown as a counterstain. the respective antibodies used are indicated above. scale bar: 10 μm.full size imageledgf/p75 has been validated as a potential target to render primary cells resistant to hiv infection in a humanized mouse model for hiv infection25. both ledgf/p75 knock-out and expression of the ibd prevented hiv infection of primary human t-cells14,25. however, since the ibd also recruits cellular binding partners and complexes to the chromatin a more subtle approach is preferred that exclusively targets the interaction with the hiv in, leaving the interactions with other cellular binding partner unaffected24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. development of small molecule inhibitors that bind the in dimer cleft (ledgins) and interfere with the interaction between ledgf/p75 and in resulted in potent inhibition of hiv replication34. nmr experiments revealed an almost identical interaction interface for all cellular binding partners of ledgf/p75, consisting of an intrinsically unstructured motif, coined ibd interaction motif (ibm)24,35. contrary to the cellular binding partners, the ledgf/p75 binding site on hiv in is structurally prearranged and covers a much larger hydrophobic surface area when binding ledgf/p7524,35. ledgf/p75 binds the hiv in dimer via the protruding aspartic acid residue at position 366 (d366)36,37. mutation of the latter residue into alanine or asparagine abrogates in binding without affecting the binding of the endogenous binding partners of ledgf/p7528,29,30.here, we demonstrate that a precise, single-point mutation of ledgf d366 at the genomic level into asparagine using crispr/cas9 technology protects cells against productive hiv infection, leaving the interaction with endogenous proteins unaffected.resultsdesign and validation of a human psip1-specific grna adjacent to the d366 codonledgf/p75 acts as a protein hub, and thus therapeutic ablation may affect several endogenous pathways that are regulated through ledgf/p7514,28,29,30,31,32,38. ledgf/p75 binds the hiv in dimer interface via the aspartic acid residue at position 366 located in the ibd36,37. well-characterized single amino-acid substitutions of the d366 in the ibd have been described that specifically disrupt in binding (d366a/n)36, leaving the interaction with other cellular binding partners of ledgf/p75 unaffected24,29,39,40. therefore, we opted to engineer the specific mutation of the aspartic residue 366 (genomically encoded in exon 12 of psip1 gene) to asparagine (n)36,37 using crispr/cas9 technology with a dna oligo template for homology directed repair (fig. 1a). to that end, a crispr/cas9 guide rna (grna) was designed to target a site 39 bp upstream of the d366 codon, designated grna1 (fig. 1b and supplemental table s1). in addition, two supplementary guide rnas were designed to recognize regions upstream and downstream of the desired site to evaluate grna1-mediated cutting efficiency (intronically upstream of exon 12 and within exon 13, referred to as grna-a and -b, respectively; fig. 1b, supplemental table s1). crispr/cas9 introduces dna double-stranded breaks (dsb) that are typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (nhej). in a first step, hek293t cells were transfected with a pair of crispr/cas plasmids encoding grna1-a and grna1-b, respectively. theoretically, this method results in single cuts for either guide but occasionally a simultaneous cut generates a segmental deletion that is detectable following pcr amplification of the genomic dna. primers were designed such that wild-type psip1 yielded an amplicon of 581 bp (large arrow heads; fig. 1c). pcr analysis showed a prominent band at the expected 581 bp size for the respective polyclonal cell populations. in addition, we observed truncated amplicons of 506 bp when combining the grna1 and grna-a pair and a 283 bp amplicon for grna1 and grna-b combination (small arrow heads; fig. 1c), corresponding to the calculated fragments, validating the individual grnas. psip1 disruption at the genomic level in the polyclonal psip1-deleted hek293t cell population was further demonstrated by a marked drop in ledgf/p75 protein levels using an antibody that binds the c-terminal end of ledgf/p75 (αledgf480–530; fig. 1d). note that some residual ledgf/p75 protein is still detectable, as expected for a polyclonal population where psip1 deletion is limited by transfection efficiency. in line, immunocytochemistry corroborated loss of nuclear ledgf/p75 in the large majority of cultured cells (94%; fig. 1e). together these data demonstrate that grna1 is functional and thus can be used in combination with a dna oligo template for homology directed repair (hdr) to generate d366n.characterization of grna1 ledgf/p75 knock-out in hek293t cellswe anticipated that the frequency of hdr events resulting in a homozygous d366n clone would be low, and that the most likely case would be obtaining heterozygous d366n mutants where the second allele contained a psip1-disrupting indel. therefore, it was important to examine the phenotype of psip1 ko cells.we used transfection to introduce grna1 and cas9 into hek293t cells. monoclonal ledgf/p75 ko cell lines were isolated via limiting dilution. individual clones were validated for psip1 disruption by western analysis and immunocytochemistry (clone 1, 2 and 3, respectively; fig. 2a,b). western blot showed undetectable levels of ledgf/p75 protein (αledgf480–530, fig. 2a). in line, no detectable ledgf/p75 protein was present in immunocytochemistry (clone 1; fig. 2b). next, we analyzed the grna1 target site for the clones lacking ledgf/p75 protein in more detail. genomic dna regions of psip1 surrounding the pam site were pcr amplified and subcloned for dna sequencing (fig. 2c), showing insertions, deletions or mutations (indels) in close proximity to the pam site (ranging from 2 to 54 bp) (fig. 2c). in most alleles, deletions caused a shift in the open reading frame, leading to a premature translation stop (clone 1; fig. 2c). in hek293t_ledgf ko clone 3, 54 bp and 36 bp were deleted in allele 1 and allele 2, respectively, resulting in elimination of the intron/exon boundary at the start of exon 12 (fig. 2c). in hek293t_ledgf ko clone 2, the targeted resequencing revealed the presence of 3 distinct alleles with variable indels (supplemental fig. 1). it has previously been observed that hek293t cell line may exhibit variable hypotriploidy, however, triploidy has never been reported for chromosome 941.figure 2characterization of hek293t_ledgf ko cell lines using a single grna1. (a) western blot analysis of ledgf/p75 protein in 3 ledgf ko clones. (b) immunocytochemical analysis of wild-type hek293t (wt) cells and monoclonal ledgf ko cells showing nuclear localization of ledgf/p75 as dense, fine speckles in wt cells (shown in green) and the lack thereof in the ko cell line. phalloidin (white) was used to counterstain cytoplasmic f-actin. ledgf ko (clone1) image is shown and is representative of all 3 isolated ko cell lines. (c) sanger sequencing of the indel profile generated in the region targeted by grna1 (“−” indicates deletion, substitutions indicated in red) and the predicted changes in the amino acid sequence of exon 12 on the right. (d) psip1 mrna expression levels with standard deviation relative to β-actin in the respective knock-out clones as determined by qpcr. error bars represent sd. student’s t test was performed using graphpad prism 7.0 software. sample means were considered significantly different from the wt control at p < 0.05 (*). scale bar: 10 µm.full size imageeven though genomic analysis predicted the potential expression of a truncated form of ledgf/p75, we were unable to detect these by western analysis when using an antibody that recognizes an epitope upstream of the ibd domain (αledgf225–275; fig. 2a). we further analyzed psip1 gene transcription by performing qpcr (fig. 2d). psip1 mrna expression was significantly reduced in all three ko lines (96%, 71% and 70% depletion in clone 1, 2 and 3, respectively; p < 0.001 student’s t test compared to wt), suggesting that the disruption of the genomic psip1 sequence influences protein expression levels by affecting mrna stability.generation of psip1 d366n mutation at gdna level in hek293t cell linea 98 bp single-stranded dna oligo template for hdr (supplemental table s1) was designed to contain a point mutation converting d366 into n (gat to aat) (fig. 3a). introduction  of the point mutation in the repair template created a vspi restriction site (a^ttaat), which was used in the screening process to identify single cell clones with the d336n mutation. an additional silent nucleotide substitution was added to eliminate the pam site (agg to aga), preventing continuous cutting by the crispr/cas9 complex (fig. 3a). hek293t cells were transfected with the crispr/cas9 plasmid carrying grna1 targeting psip1 exon12 along with the hdr template in a form of a single-stranded dna oligo. clones were screened by immunocytochemistry to identify the ledgf ko clones. ledgf/p75-positive clones were subjected to pcr amplification of the genomic dna to identify d366n mutants: the amplicon for the wild-type or a ledgf ko allele would give rise to a 581 bp fragment, whereas amplicons carrying d366n yielded two fragments following digestion with vspi at 296 bp and 285 bp (supplemental fig. 2). for a single allelic change, the wild-type band at 581 bp would also be present. a total of 38 individual clones were screened. two clones were identified based on the predicted pcr banding pattern (clone 4 and 35, respectively; supplemental fig. 2) and were analysed in detail by subcloning of the individual isolated amplicons and subsequent sequencing of each allele. clone 4 contained the desired point mutation at d366 residue in one of the alleles but unfortunately also had indels in the sequence upstream of d366n (supplemental fig. 3). in clone 35, one of the alleles matched the d366n hdr template and the other allele contained an 8-nucleotide deletion at the dsb site resulting in a ledgf ko genotype (fig. 3b). the sequencing result of clone 35 was corroborated by western blot analysis showing the ledgf d366n protein with the same gel migration as the wild-type protein, whereas no protein was detected for the control cell line, ledgf ko clone1 (fig. 3c).figure 3hdr template design and screening.

(b) sanger sequencing results for the hek293t_ledgf d366n clone that was identified, showing consensus between hdr template and allele 1 (substitution indicated in red). the sequence for allele 2 shows a 8-nucleotide deletion (“−” indicates deletion) and the translation (capital letters below) resulting in a premature stop codon (underlined). (c) western blot analysis showing the ledgf/p75 levels in d366n clone compared to wt levels.full size imageledgf d366n mutant fails to interact with hiv integrase in hek293tmutation of d366 into n only affects the interaction of ledgf/p75 with lentiviral in36, leaving the interaction with cellular binding partners unaffected28,29,30. therefore, we evaluated the capacity of the genomic ledgf d366n mutant to interact with the known cellular interacting partners jpo2 and iws124,29,40, whose binding sites are mutually exclusive from hiv-in but lie in close proximity to the d366 residue. endogenous ledgf/p75 and ledgf d366n were readily detected in hek293t cells using α-ledgf480–530 (fig. 4) and revealed the typical ledgf dense fine speckled pattern in the nucleus (fig. 4; green fluorescence, left column of a, b and c). the nuclear distribution of ledgf/p75 (hek293t_wt) and ledgf d366n was comparable, suggesting that d366n mutation did not affect the subcellular localization of ledgf/p75. next, these cells, together with ledgf ko cells as control, were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding flag-tagged versions of iws1, jpo2 and hiv-in, respectively, to assess co-localization (α-flag, red fluorescent signal, fig. 4). in both hek293t_wt and hek293t_ledgf d366n co-localized with iws1 and jpo2 in the nucleus, indicating that the d366n mutation did not affect the interaction with these proteins (right column, lower panel; fig. 4a,b). transiently expressed hiv-in located to the nucleus in hek293t wt cells, whereas it distributed throughout the cell for hek293t_ledgf d366n with a preference for the cytoplasm, suggesting it failed to bind ledgf d366n, in line with hek293t_ko clone 1 (fig. 4c). to further confirm that the interaction between ledgf d366n and hiv in was disrupted but was retained with jpo2 and iws1, we performed coip experiments by transiently expressing the ledgf wt or mutant d366n along with the respective binding partners in ledgf ko hek293t cells. as seen in co-localization experiment above, coip corroborated the interaction between ledgf d366n and jpo2 or iws1 (fig. 4d, left and middle panels) to be similar to the wt condition. however, hiv in did not coip ledgf d366n (fig. 4d, right panel), whereas the ledgf wt protein was precipitated.figure 4ledgf d366n mutant is uncoupled from hiv-in but interacts with other binding partners. (a–c) in vivo co-localization of the ledgf d366n and cellular binding partners. wild-type hek293t, ledgf ko and ledgf d366n cells were transfected with flag-tagged iws1, jpo2 and hiv-in (panels a, b and c, respectively) and fixed 30 hrs later. fluorescence microscopy to assess localization of proteins: ledgf/p75 and ledgf d366n were detected using αledgf480–530 (shown in green), whereas the transfected flag-tagged proteins were detected with αflag ab (shown in red).

(d) co-immunoprecipitation of ledgf/p75 and ledgf d366n by cellular binding partners. hek293t_ledgf ko cells were transfected with either wt or d366n mutant ledgf plasmid along with either one of the plasmids encoding flag-tagged binding partners: iws1, jpo2 or hiv in. cells were lysed 24 h later and lysates were incubated with anti-flag® m2-agarose affinity resin to capture the binding partner protein, which was then visualized by western blot using αflag ab and αledgf480–530.full size imagetogether, these experiments validate our approach and demonstrate that mutation of the protruding aspartic acid residue d366 of ledgf/p75 disrupts binding of hiv in, while maintaining the interaction with cellular binding partners.crispr-based psip1 knock-out renders supt1 cells resistant to hiv-1 infectionhuman cd4+ t cells are the major target cells of hiv-1 infection, and thus most interesting to render hiv resistant. in a first step, we set out to determine whether crispr/cas9-mediated psip1 gene disruption protects supt1 cells from hiv-1 infection. in order to efficiently disrupt psip1 in a polyclonal population, we generated supt1 cells constitutively expressing cas9 nuclease. the supt1-cas9 cells were then electroporated with a plasmid encoding the grna1 and gfp. gfp-positive cells were sorted to enrich the percentage of psip1-deleted cells. the resulting polyclonal populations were facs-analyzed to assess ledgf/p75 expression levels (supplemental fig. 4a,b). non-sorted cells displayed a 72% knock-out efficiency, whereas gfp-sorted cells showed an 88% knock-out efficiency using grna1. individual ledgf ko clones were obtained through limiting dilution and screened by immunocytochemistry (using α-ledgf480–530; not shown). for three of the monoclonal cell lines (supt1_ledgf ko clone 1, 2 and 3, respectively), we amplified and sequenced the genomic region flanking the pam cleavage site to determine the indel profile for both alleles (fig. 5a). the indels in supt1_ledgf ko clone 1 and clone 2 generated a frameshift mutation in both alleles, resulting in a premature stop codon (fig. 5a). one of the alleles in clone 2 had a deletion beyond the intron11-exon12 boundary. in supt1_ledgf ko clone 3, the second allele had an 8-amino-acid deletion but remained in frame leaving the possibility of a truncated form of ledgf/p75. loss of ledgf/p75 protein was corroborated by western analysis using the c-terminal specific antibody (α-ledgf480–530) as well as the antibody recognizing the epitope in the cr region upstream of ibd (α-ledgf225–275), to identify a potentially truncated form of ledgf/p75 (fig. 5b). whereas both antibodies readily detected ledgf/p75 in wild-type supt1 cells (supt1_wt), no detectable protein was observed for any of the clones tested, implying that the indels generated at the site of cleavage destabilized the protein and/or the psip1 mrna. in line with the analysis completed on hek293t_ledgf ko cell lines, we assessed psip1 mrna levels and showed significant reduction in all three supt1_ledgf ko lines (fig. 5c; 83%, 90% and 93% depletion, respectively), again demonstrating that disruption of psip1 at genomic level results in substantially lower mrna levels and in loss of ledgf/p75 protein.figure 5hiv replication is severely affected in supt1_ledgf ko cells.

(d) hiv-1 replication assay. the respective cell lines were challenged with the laboratory hivnl4.3 strain at a final concentration of 5.0*102 pg p24. viral replication was monitored by daily sampling of p24 in the cell culture supernatant. the graph shows a representative infection experiment out of three independent trials.full size imagenext, we assessed whether the supt1_ledgf ko clones supported hiv-1 replication and challenged the respective cell lines with the laboratory strain hivnl4.3. in a viral replication assay supt1_wt cells consistently showed peak viral replication between day 4 and 7 post infection (fig. 5d), whereas in the respective knock-out cell lines hiv failed to replicate when followed for 10 days post infection. thus, crispr/cas9 mediated disruption of psip1 in supt1 cells is able to prevent hiv replication, in line with previous work14,26.residual hiv-1 integrants adopt a latent phenotype in psip1 knock-out supt1 cellshiv-1 and other lentiviruses preferentially integrate into actively-transcribed regions of the genomic dna in the presence of ledgf/p7542. it was recently reported that depletion of ledgf/p75, known to reduce integration and to alter the integration profile of residual hiv integrants26,43,44 also demonstrates a more quiescent phenotype that is refractory to re-activation43,44. to examine the degree of lentiviral integration and to assess the ratio of productive versus latent transduction, we used the single-round, orange-green hiv-1 (fig. 6a; hivogh) double reporter virus that allowed quantification of actively-infected (egfp+, mko2+) and latently-infected (egfp−, mko2+) cell populations45,46. supt1_wt and the respective supt1_ledgf ko cell lines were challenged with a dilution series of hivogh. the percentage of infected cells was evaluated on day 3 post infection, discriminating productively infected cells (egfp+, mko2+) from the latently-infected populations (egfp−, mko2+). depletion of ledgf/p75 reduced the overall transduction efficiency by 4-fold (compare % mko2+ cells for different vector dilutions; fig. 6b)44,47. moreover, in line with earlier data43, the larger portion of proviruses were latent (latent fraction = percent egfp−/mko2+ cells over total mko2+ cells; fig. 6c). in supt1_wt cells, higher viral concentrations result in more productively infected cell numbers (lower % of latently infected cells; fig. 6c). for the respective ledgf/p75 crispr-ko cell lines between 80–95% of the cells were quiescently infected. although the relative percentages are different between the ko clones, the pattern persisted over a series of viral dilutions (fig. 6c).figure 6ledgf depletion results in an increase of the silent hiv reservoir.

(b) hiv provirus integration is greatly diminished in the absence of ledgf/p75 when compared to supt1_wt cells, as evidenced by the lower %mko2 positive cells for a given virus concentration. error bars represent sd. student’s t test was performed using graphpad prism 7.0 software. sample means were considered significantly different from the wt control at p < 0.05 (*).

(a) sanger sequencing results showing consensus between hdr template and allele 1. the hdr template is shown with red characters indicating the sites of nucleotide substitutions, generating a vspi restriction site at d366n and deleting the pam site. the sequence for allele 2 shows a 22-nucleotide deletion grna1 (“−” indicates deletion), resulting in ko of the psip1 allele. (b) western blot analysis for the supt1_ledgf d366n clone using c-terminal specific ledgf antibody, αledgf480–530. supt1_wt and ko cells are included as controls. (c) immunocytochemical analysis of ledgf d366n protein (green) in supt1_ledgf d366n cells (bottom panel) recapitulates that of ledgf/p75 in supt1_wt cells (top panel). phalloidin (white) was used to stain f-actin. scale bar: 10 µm.full size imagenext, we challenged the supt1_ledgf d366n cells with hivnl4.3 virus. the cells carrying the d366n mutation demonstrated resistance to the hiv challenge, showing no viral replication following infection with the hivnl4.3 laboratory strain (fig. 8a). also, we challenged the supt1_ledgf d366n mutant cells with the hivogh double-reporter virus to determine whether the d366n mutation affects the integration and integrant distribution to a latent proviral pool. in line with what we observed in the supt1_ledgf ko cells, transduction efficiency was about 4-fold lower in the supt1_ledgf d366n cells compared to the supt1_wt cells (compare % mko2+ cells for different vector dilutions; fig. 8b). besides a lower transduction efficiency, a higher proportion of the remaining infections in supt1_ledgf d366n cells was transcriptionally silent, even at higher concentrations of hivogh virus (egfp−, mko2+ cells / total mko2+ cells; fig. 8c). for the supt1_ledgf d366n cells about 95% of the cells were quiescently infected, which was corroborated for a wide range of viral dilutions, whereas the latent fraction in supt1_wt cells dropped substantially at higher virus concentrations (fig. 8c).figure 8hiv replication is hampered in supt1_ledgf d366n cell line as compared to the supt1 wt cell line. (a) hiv-1 replication assay. the cell lines were challenged with the laboratory hivnl4.3 strain at a final concentration of 5.0*102 pg p24. replication was monitored by daily sampling of the p24 levels in the cell culture supernatant. (b) introduction  of the d366n mutation in ledgf/p75 renders supt1 cells refractory to transduction as shown by a 4-fold decrease in %mko2 expressing cells for a given vsv-g pseudotyped hivogh virus concentration. student’s t test was performed using graphpad prism 7.0 software. sample means were considered significantly different from the wt control at p < 0.05 (*). (c) in addition to the lower transduction efficiency observed for supt1_ledgf d366n, the latent fraction is greater when compared to supt1_wt cells, even at higher concentrations of hivogh virus. egfp, enhanced green fluorescent protein; mko2, mutant kusubira orange 2. the plots represent one of three independent infection experiments.full size imageledgf d366n mutation confers resistance to hiv-1 challenge even at high moiin an effort to test whether the hiv-1 virus could escape and grow resistant by adapting to the ledgf d366n point-mutation, we performed longer-term hivnl4.3 replication experiments at low and at high moi and monitored replication for more than 4 weeks (fig. 9). for low moi experiments, we pelleted 5*105 of supt1 cells (supt1_wt, supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 and supt1_ledgf d366n, respectively) and challenged these with 1.5*106 pg p24 of hivnl4.3 for 2 hrs before washing the cells, resulting in a final dose of approximately 2*102 pg p24/ml. while p24 concentration readily increased in supt1_wt cells, hiv replication was not detected in both supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 and supt1_ledgf d366n within 4 weeks (fig. 9a). for the high moi experiments, 5*105 supt1_wt, supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 and supt1_ledgf d366n cells were challenged with 5*106 pg p24 hivnl4.3 but were not washed to remove the initial inoculum, resulting in a final dose of 1*106 pg p24/ml. although the p24 concentration in the supernatant was high compared to p24 concentration at day 0 (fig. 9a), hiv replication was detected from day 5 onwards in supt1_wt cells, whereas no replication was detected in supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 and supt1_ledgf d366n, where p24 values remained constant or declined. on day 15, hiv replication was also detected in supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 cells (fig. 9b), which is in line with an earlier report, where hrp-2 was shown to take over the tethering function of ledgf/p75 in ledgf depleted cells48. however, in supt1_ledgf d366n no viral replication was detected when monitored for 33 days post infection, indicating that the more nuanced approach using gene editing renders cells more resistant to hiv escape than the ablation of ledgf/p75.figure 9hiv replication remains hampered in supt1 ledgf d366n cell line at high moi as compared to the supt1 wt and supt1 ledgf ko cell line. (a) hiv-1 replication assay at low moi. the cell lines were challenged with the laboratory hivnl4.3 strain at a concentration of 1.5*106 pg p24 for 2 h. the cells were then washed to remove the virus to result in 5.0*102 pg/ml p24 final concentration and monitored for replication. (b) hiv-1 replication assay at high moi. the cell lines were challenged with the laboratory hivnl4.3 strain at a final concentration of 1.5*106 pg p24. replication was monitored by daily sampling of the p24 levels in the cell culture supernatant. each plot represents one of three independent infection experiments.full size imagediscussion the definitive success of the antiretroviral drugs at controlling hiv replication has turned the once deadly hiv infection into a manageable, chronic illness. however, even though it revolutionized the treatment of hiv disease, cart cannot eradicate hiv virus and thus does not provide a cure. following treatment interruption, viral replication rebounds despite years of treatment. reactivation of the latent hiv reservoir necessitates a lifelong, daily medication regimen with considerable unwanted complications, such as emergence of viral resistance, chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, accelerated aging, cardiovascular disease, liver and renal failure, neurocognitive dysfunction, and hiv related malignancies49,50,51,52. given the limitations and complications of antiretroviral therapy, curative strategies to treat hiv disease are considered high-priority. two main approaches have garnered considerable attention over the past decade: purging of the latently infected reservoir using latency reversing agents and protection of uninfected hiv target cells through site-specific gene targeting or gene therapy53,54,55. a tropism-independent approach to rendering cd4+ t cells refractory to hiv infection is to target the integration step of the hiv replication cycle by uncoupling the viral in from the host integration facilitator ledgf/p75.ledgf/p75 knock-down experiments have previously shown that hiv replication is greatly impaired, however, the residual functional activity, even at very low expression levels, eventually results in hiv breakthrough in spreading infection studies56,57,58. more recently, a number of stable ledgf knock-out cell lines were generated by different site-specific gene targeting approaches demonstrating profound reduction in spreading hiv-1 replication, exceeding the replication delays observed for stable knock-down cd4-t cell lines14,26 establishing the role of ledgf/p75 as a co-factor for efficient viral propagation. the knock-out approach has shown no deleterious phenotype in mature t-cells, however, a recent study demonstrated that knocking out psip1 in vivo leads to hematopoietic defect, showing a two-fold reduction in peripheral lymphocytes as well as a lower numbers of hscs, splenocytes, and thymocytes59. moreover, ledgf/p75 has been shown to interact with numerous cellular proteins via its in binding domain (ibd), ruling out complete psip1 ablation as a potential therapeutic strategy. interestingly, structural characterization of the ibd interactions showed that the cellular binding partners of ledgf/p75 interact with the ibd through an intrinsically unstructured ibd-binding motif (ibm), whereas in is structurally prearranged and binds the ibd via a larger hydrophobic surface area24,35. mutation of the protruding aspartic acid residue d366 in the ledgf ibd specifically disrupts binding of the hiv in dimer36,37, leaving the binding of cellular binding partners unaffected. we used crispr/cas9 gene editing to generate stable psip1 (ledgf) knock-out cell lines as well as a psip1 d366n mutant line designed to disrupt the successful binding of hiv in.single-amino acid substitution was achieved by generating a double-stranded break using crispr/cas9 and relying on homology directed repair pathway to recombine with the provided repair template oligo carrying the d366n mutation. the editing process proved inefficient with hdr taking place in approximately 12% of cells under hdr-promoting experimental conditions. this low efficiency is most likely due to the distance between the site of the dsb and the d366 residue being 39 bp, highlighting the clear limitation of the crispr/cas system in its dependence on the pam site. it has previously been reported that the frequency of hdr is negatively correlated with the distance from dsb38. the mutation of the pam site, 5 bp way from dsb, which was also encoded in the repair oligo, had a 10-fold increase in frequency compared to d366n (data not shown). a modified cas9 with an alternative pam (ngan) site has been synthesized able to generate a cut 3 bp away from our desired location60. this new cas9 mutant could potentially increase the editing frequency, provided that the grna targeting efficiency is retained, making d366n knock-in strategy more applicable clinically. alternatively, cas9 rnps have been shown to generate knock-in edits in primary t cells61. even though currently the efficiency of the knock-in editing process is significantly lower than that of knock-outs, as technology evolves, we expect this approach will become more feasible.we were able to isolate a clone of each modified cell line carrying the desired mutation in one psip1 allele, while the other allele was knocked-out. the hek293t_d366n mutant clone demonstrated successful uncoupling from hiv-in in the co-localization study, whereas ledgf/p75 interaction partners jpo2 and iws1 retained their binding ability. the supt1_d366n mutant clone did not support hiv replication when challenged with hivnl4.3 (fig. 8a), in line with previously reported data25. these data were corroborated using the double reporter hivogh: infection of supt1_ledgf ko and d336n cells was 4–5-fold less efficient compared to supt1_wt cells (% mko2+ cells in figs 6 and 8, respectively). in addition, the remaining hivogh viruses that were able to integrate in the absence of ledgf/p75 were shown to be predominantly quiescent, limiting the probability of mounting a productive infection, in line with earlier data43.the ability of the crispr/cas system to generate a true genetic knock-out allows for functional interrogation in a well-defined genetic system. in both the hek293t and supt1 cells, the disruption in the ibd region within exon12 using crispr/cas resulted in efficient knock-out. transient transfection with grna-loaded crispr/cas plasmid resulted in 94% ledgf/p75 protein knock-out in hek293ts and 88% in supt1 cells after electroporation and sorting for successfully transfected cells as determined by the facs analysis of polyclonal populations. we could not demonstrate residual or truncated ledgf/p75 protein in the grna1 crispred ledgf ko clones using western analysis or immunocytochemistry. analysis of psip1 expression in the isolated clones revealed that mrna levels were also significantly reduced (figs 2d and 5c). frame-shift mutations in coding genetic regions have been shown to trigger nonsense-mediated mrna decay (nmd)62, which serves as mrna quality check-point mechanism to prevent translation of transcripts with a premature stop codon thus eliminating the potential toxic effects of truncated proteins. the sequencing results for two of the three knock-out clones in both hek293t (clone 1 and 3) and supt1 (clone 1 and 2) cells showed frame-shift mutations resulting in a premature stop codon in both alleles, corroborating the theory of nmd as the probable degradation pathway. supt1_ko clone 3 showed a premature stop codon in one allele and an in-frame 8 amino-acids deletion in the other, yet a 98% depletion of mrna was observed, suggesting an alternative mrna decay pathway. similarly, the hek293t_ko clone 2, which was determined through targeted resequencing to be triploid in the crispr/cas-edited region (supplemental fig. 1), showed a premature stop codon in two of the alleles and a single amino acid deletion (q353) in the third allele. the mrna was 70% depleted relative to the wt psip1 mrna levels. the 30% expression level may indicate that the mrna of the delq353 allele was stable, however, no ledgf protein was detected. q353 is part of a highly ordered helix bundle consisting of 4 helices in the ibd of ledgf/p75 and modeling analysis predicts the sole deletion of q353 to result in a shift in the helical pattern, destabilizing the entire structure, resulting in failure to fold properly, and targeting the mutant for degradation.analyses of spreading hiv-1 infection in the supt1 stable ledgf ko cell lines showed an hiv replication defect, corroborating the previously reported replication delays in talen-edited jurkat cells and in other human cd4+ t cell lines with a stable shrna-mediated knockdown14,26,44. moreover, when using a double-reporter single round hivogh virus, we demonstrated 4–5 fold reduced transduction efficiency (% mko2 positive cells) in ledgf d366n cells. additionally, for the remaining integrated proviruses, the fraction of mko2+ cells that were gfp negative (latent fraction) was higher in the supt1_ledgf d366n cells (fig. 8c), in line with what we observed for supt1_ledgf ko clones (fig. 5c) and previously reported data for ledgf/p75 depleted and ledgin treated cells43. one could argue that the more nuanced approach of gene editing carries the inherent danger of easier hiv-1 escape by adaptation of hiv in to the point-mutated ledgf d366n. however, long-term replication assays using the laboratory hivnl4.3 strain at high moi in supt1_wt, supt1_ledgf ko and supt1_ledgf d366n cells showed hiv replication in supt1_wt and supt1_ledgf ko cells, albeit with a delay in the supt1_ledgf ko (fig. 9b). the latter is in line with other reports and can be attributed to hrp-244. like ledgf/p75, hrp-2 carries a pwwp and an integrase binding domain (ibd), however hrp-2 binds in with lower affinity and can only substitute for ledgf/p75 when ledgf/p75 is ablated. interestingly, no viral replication was detected in supt1_ledgf d366n cells that were monitored for up to 33 days post infection, demonstrating that the gene editing approach rendered cells more resistant to hiv escape than the ablation of ledgf/p75. a possible explanation for the latter results is that in supt1-ledgf d366n cells the d366n mutation prevents hiv in to bind its natural tether, leaving hrp-2 as the privileged binding partner. but with the ledgf d366n protein still occupying its cognate chromatin sites the hrp-2 protein is prevented from docking. in the absence of ledgf/p75 (supt1_ledgf ko), however, ledgf/p75 chromatin binding positions are accessible for hrp-2 leading to replication.with zfn-based ccr5 knock-out as first-line gene therapy target in phase ii clinical trials63, the gene therapy approach is gaining traction as a promising curative therapeutic treatment for hiv64. the crispr/cas system has proven time and again to be the most efficient, adaptable and scalable tool for genetic ablation and editing65,66. the observation that editing ledgf/p75 did not result in evident defect in laboratory t cells14,26 opens perspectives to combine psip1 and ccr5 for combinatorial site-specific gene targeting. indeed, an arrayed editing of hiv entry co-receptors in combination with ledgf/p75 was validated as a protective strategy against hiv-1 in primary t-cells14. although disruption of ccr5, cxcr4 and ledgf/p75 appears to be tolerated by cd4+ t-cells in vitro, ablation of any gene would need to be thoroughly studied before being considered for any cell-based therapy. in our study, the precise editing of ledgf/p75 using the d366n knock-in approach circumvents any potential deficiency stemming from ledgf/p75 disruption, while protecting cells against hiv infection. similar efforts can be employed in generating ccr5 and cxcr4 knock-ins refractory to hiv.methodscell culturecells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 at 37 °c. supt1 (t-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma; provided by the national institutes of health (nih) reagent program, nih, bethesda, md) and were cultured in rpmi (gibco) with 10% v/v fcs (sigma-aldrich). hek293t cells (gift from o. danos, evry, france) were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle medium (dmem, gibco) with 5% v/v fcs (sigma-aldrich) and 0.01% v/v gentamicin (gibco).crispr/cas tools and guide validationguide rnas were generated using the crispr design and analysis tool from the massachusetts institute of technology (http://crispr.mit.edu) and ligated into crispr/cas9 plasmids as previously described67. briefly, the 24 bp forward and reverse primers including the 20-bp target sequence and bbsi sticky ends were annealed and ligated into pspcas9(bb)-2a-gfp (px458) plasmid (addgene plasmid #48138), a gift from feng zhang67. primer sequences are shown in supplemental table s1. for transfection of cell lines that constitutively express cas9 protein, a smaller, guiderna-scaffold only plasmid encoding the egfp reporter to facilitate cell sorting was generated. to that end, the cas9 orf was removed from px330 plasmid (addgene #42230, gift from feng zhang) using hindiii and ecori. the egfp under sffv-promoter sequence was then ligated into the modified px330 backbone resulting in a plasmid 4267 bp in size named px321-egfp. for production of cas9 lentiviral vector transfer plasmid, the grna scaffold and the u6 promoter were removed from the lenticrispr v2 plasmid (addgene #52961, gift from feng zhang) by digesting it with pst1 and ecori and a 207 bp adaptor sequence was inserted resulting in a plasmid 12674 bp in size named lenticrisprv2+ adaptor. the resulting lentiviral vector expresses cas9 and a puromycin resistance cdna, and is referred to as lv_cas9-i-puror. all cloning steps were sequence verified.for guide rna validation experiment, guides 1, a and b were cloned into px330 plasmid individually and transfected into hek293t cells in equimolar amounts in pairs (grna 1+ a; grna 1+ b) using polyethylene-imine (pei) transfection agent. the cells were allowed to expand for 5 days before collection for western blot and genomic dna analysis. to assess the presence of the segmental deletion in the genome, a pair of primers was designed to anneal outside the regions recognized by grna1 and b (supplemental table s1 and fig. 1b). the truncation in the genome was detected by assessing the pcr product size observed on an agarose gel. the amplicon size of 581 bp would indicate either a wt sequence or a sequence that has been cut with a single grna. for a segmental deletion, a band size of 506 bp for guide pair 1+ a or 283 bp for guide pair 1+ b would be observed on an agarose gel, indicating that both guides within a pair are functional (fig. 1c).generation of stable knock-out and d366n knock-in cells lineshek293t_ledgf ko cells were generated by transient transfection of px458 plasmid containing grna1 using branched polyethylene-imine (pei) transfection agent (sigma-aldrich). cells were sorted for gfp using fluorescence activated cell sorting (bio-rad s3) 48 h after electroporation and were allowed to expand for one week before seeding for monoclonal expansion into a 96 well plate. the individual clones were screened by western blot and immunocytochemical analysis.to generate ledgf d366n cells, ssodn repair oligo from idt (leuven, belgium) was added at 10pm concentration to the transfection mix. scr7 compound (1 µm) (apexbio a8705-5) was added to the cells immediately after transfection and left on for 24 h. cells were sorted for gfp using fluorescence activated cell sorting (bio-rad s3) 48 h after electroporation and were allowed to expand for one week before seeding for monoclonal expansion into a 96 well plate. the individual clones were screened by isolating genomic dna and amplifying the d366 region of 581 bp using primer set reported in supplemental table s1. the presence of n366 was detected by vspi digest.to generate supt1_ledgf ko and d366n cells, supt1-cas9 cells were generated first to constitutively express cas9 nuclease using lv_cas9-i-puror and subsequent puromycin selection. for electroporation of px321-gfp into supt1-cas9 cells, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl serum-free rpmi medium with 10 μg of plasmid. cells were transferred into an electroporation cuvette and electroporated (175 v, 6 pulses) using gene pulser xcell system (bio-rad). cells were sorted for gfp using fluorescence activated cell sorting (bio-rad s3) 48 h after electroporation and were allowed to expand for one week before seeding for monoclonal expansion into a 96 well plate. for hdr experiments, ssodn repair oligo from idt (leuven, belgium) was used at 10pm concentration along with px321-gfp plasmid. scr7 compound (1 µm) (apexbio a8705-5) was added to the cells immediately after transfection and left on for 24 h. the individual clones were screened by isolating genomic dna and amplifying the d366 region of 581 bp using primer set reported in supplemental table s1. the presence of n366 was detected by vspi digest.western blot analysiswestern blotting was performed as described previously58. briefly, cells were seeded at 3*105 cell/well in 6-well plates and grown overnight. cells were washed twice with 1x pbs and subsequently crude lysates were prepared using 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds, sigma-aldrich). lysates were boiled for 2 minutes, and gdna was sheared through an insulin-needle. protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (bca, pierce bca protein assay kit, thermoscientific). in total, 20 μg protein was used for electrophoresis on a 4–15% tris-glycine gel (criterion tgx precast midi protein gel). next, proteins were electroblotted on a polyvinylene difluoride membrane (pvdf; biorad). after protein transfer, the membrane was blocked using 5% milk-powder in 0.1% pbs-triton. ledgf/p75 was detected using rabbit anti-human ledgf polyclonal antibody at 1:500 on at 4 °c (a300–848a and a300–847a; bethyl laboratories inc., montgomery, tx). after 4 wash steps in 0.1% pbs-triton the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody at 1:10000 for 1 h (goat anti-rabbit conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase (hrp), dako). flag-tagged proteins were detected using monoclonal anti-flag m2 antibody produced in mouse (1:1000; f1804, sigma-aldrich) and a secondary goat anti-mouse hrp (1:10000, dako). equal loading was verified using either α-tubulin at 1:5000 (t-9026; sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo) or β-tubulin at 1:5000 (t-8328; sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo). protein signals were detected using western ecl substrate (biorad) on a las-3000 imaging system (fuji).immunocytochemistry and co-immunoprecipitation analysisfor immunocytochemistry analysis, 3*104 hek293t cells were seeded in lab-tektm microscopy chamber slides (thermoscientific). after 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with ledgf antibody at 1:400 (a300–848a, bethyl laboratories inc, montgomery, tx). alexa fluor® phalloidin 555 (a34055, thermofisher) was used as f-actin counterstain.for protein co-localization and coip experiments plasmid constructs that expressed 3xflag-tagged versions of iws1, jpo2 and hiv in, pchmws ins-3xflag-i-puror, pchmws 3xflag hsiws1-i-hygror, pchmws 3xflag jpo2-i-hygror, were described by tesina et al.24. plasmid constructs to express ledgf and ledgf d366n, pgae-sffv ledgf bc-i-bsdr and pgae-sffv ledgf bc d366n-i-bsdr, respectively were previously described68.for co-localization experiments, wt and d366n hek 293 t cells were transfected with plasmid constructs carrying flag-tagged jpo2, iws1, or hiv-in 30 h prior to fixation. flag tag was detected using flag antibody at 1:1000 for 24 h (f4725, sigma). samples were analyzed using lsm 510 meta imaging unit (carl zeiss, zaventem, belgium) as described before39.coip was essentially performed as described earlier with small modifications69. briefly, 5.8 × 106 hek293t_ledgf ko clone1 cells were plated in a 8.5 cm dish and transfected the next day with plasmid that expressed either ledgf or ledgf d366n (20 μg for pgae-sffv ledgf bc-i-bsdr and pgae-sffv ledgf bc d366n-i-bsdr, respectively) together with a plasmid construct that expressed the ledgf cellular binding proteins, in-3xflag, 3xflag-iws1 or 3xflag-jpo2 (20 μg pchmws ins-3xflag-i-puror and 30 μg pchmws 3xflag hsiws1-i-hygror, pchmws 3xflag jpo2-i-hygror, respectively) using branched pei. the next day, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (1x pbs) and lysed in 700 μl cytoplasmic lysis buffer/plate (20 mm tris-hcl ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 0.1%[v/v] igepal, 1 mm dtt and 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail [roche, germany]) for 10 min on ice. nuclei were pelleted at 4000xg and lysed in 500 μl nuclear lysis buffer (cytoplasmic lysis buffer with 400 mm nacl) for 60 min on ice. the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18000 × g and incubated with 25 μl anti-flag®m2-agarose affinity resin (sigma-aldrich). the beads were pelleted by centrifugation (30 s, 1000 × g, 4 °c) and washed 3 times in 600 μl 400 mm nacl cytoplasmic lysis buffer. immuno-precipitated protein was eluted with 40 μl sds-page loading dye and visualized by western blotting.sequencing of crispr-targeted genomic regionthe genomic dna was isolated using genelute™ mammalian genomic dna miniprep kit (g1n70, sigma). the pcr fragments (581 bp) were amplified using fwd and rv primers (supplemental table s1) with the following conditions: denaturing for 30 sec at 95 °c, followed by 32 cycles of 10 sec at 95 °c, 30 sec at 58 °c, and 30 sec at 72 °c, followed by 5 min of final extension at 72 °c. the amplicons were then cloned into the pcrii-topo plasmid (invitrogen, merelbeke, belgium) and sequenced with primers m13-fwd and m13-rev (supplemental table s1).miseq targeted resequencing analysis of crispred genomic regionthe region of interest was amplified with q5 polymerase (m0491s, neb) using miseq primers appended with overhang adapter sequence (supplemental table s1), resulting in a 260 bp amplicon. the amplicons were then indexed with multiplexing indices in the subsequent limited-cycle pcr step (nextera® xt index kit, fc-131-1001, illumina). the products were purified (28106, qiagen), quantified and diluted before loading into miseq cartridge. miseq reagent kit (300-cycles – pe) ms-102-1001 was used for sequencing in the miseq system (sy410-1003, illumina). the sequencing reads where processed using fastq-mcf (ea-utils) and a quality control was performed with fastqc. subsequently the reads were mapped with bowtie2 to the human genome (hg38). integrative genomics viewer (igv) was used for further analysis, together with a number of custom-made scripts.quantitative pcrquantification of psip1 mrna levels was performed as described previously47. β-actin was used as endogenous house-keeping control (taqman control reagent; applied biosystems). all samples were run in triplicate for 3 minutes at 95 °c followed by 50 cycles of 10 seconds at 95 °c and 30 seconds at 55 °c. data were analyzed with iq5 optical system software (biorad, nazareth, belgium).hiv viral replication assayhiv replication experiments were performed at low and at high moi. for standard experiments (low moi), we pelleted 5*105 of supt1 cells (supt1_wt, supt1_ledgf ko clone 3, supt1_ledgf ko clone3 bc or supt1_ledgf d366n) and challenged these with 1.5*106 pg p24 of hivnl4.3. after 2 hrs of infection, cells were washed twice with 1xpbs and resuspended in 5 ml of culture medium in t25 flasks resulting in a final dose of around 5*102 pg p24/ml. in addition, high moi experiments were performed using 5*105 cells (supt1_wt, supt1_ledgf ko clone 3 and supt1_ledgf d366n) seeded in 5 ml of medium in t25 flasks and infected with 5*106 pg p24, resulting in a final dose of 1*106 pg p24/ml. the viral inoculum was not washed. hiv replication was monitored by daily sampling of the supernatants and subsequent quantification by p24 elisa (alliance hiv-1 p24 elisa kit: perkin elmer). cells were split 1/2 every 2 days.multi-colored reporter virus (hivogh), lentiviral vector production and transductiona variant of the recently described lai-based double reporter virus was used, where a constitutive and an ltr-driven reporter are simultaneously measured to study the latent reservoir45,46,70. this orange-green hiv-1 (ogh) reporter virus variant encodes ltr-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) together with a constitutively active ef1alpha promoter driving monomeric kusabira-orange2 (mko2) expression. through the constitutively active ef1α promoter, all cells carrying an integrated provirus express the mko2 reporter; egfp expression is driven by the active ltr promoter is a marker for an active provirus and are productively infected. the mko positive cells that do not express egfp are considered to contain silent or latent provirus. hivogh was prepared as described earlier with small modifications43. briefly, vesicular stomatitis virus g (vsv-g)-pseudotyped single-round viruses were generated by double transfection of hek293t cells with a plasmid encoding a single round hiv clone pogh together with a vsv-g protein encoding plasmid (pvsvg), using branched pei (mw 25,000; sigma-aldrich). medium was replaced 6 h post transfection and supernatant collected after 72 h by filtration through a 0.45 μm pore membrane (millexha, millipore). the virus was concentrated using an amicon 50 kda cut-off column (millipore) by centrifugation at 3000 × g, dnase (roche) treated (at 10 u/μg plasmid dna) for 2 hrs and stored at −80 °c. for transduction, cells were seeded at 25,000 cell/well and infected for 3 days in 48-well plates (10% fcs, 0.01% gentamicin rpmi) yielding an infection rate < 40% positive cells, as monitored by facs analysis using a macs quant vyb facs analyzer (miltenyi biotech gmbh), ensuring single-copy integration. cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (pbs) 72 h post infection to remove residual virus and reseeded. facs samples were taken every 2 days to monitor reporter gene expression.for lentiviral vector production, triple plasmid transfection was done with the transfer plasmid (lenticrispr v2 + adaptor) together with the p8.91 packaging plasmid and pvsvg in ratio of 15:10:5, respectively, using branched pei (mw 25,000; sigma-aldrich). medium was replaced 24 h post transfection and supernatant collected after 48 h by filtration through a 0.45 μm pore membrane (millexha, millipore). the lentiviral vector was concentrated using an amicon 50 kda cut-off column (millipore) to 1 ml and stored at −80 °c.

Anti-HIV-1 integrase potency of methylgallate from Alchornea cordifolia using in vitro and in silico approaches,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41403-x,Research,18 March 2019,yes,"according to the 2018 report of the united nations programme on hiv/aids (unaids), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), remains a significant public health problem. the non-existence of a cure or effective vaccine for the disease and the associated emergence of resistant viral strains imply an urgent need for the discovery of novel anti-hiv drug candidates. the current study aimed to identify potential anti-retroviral compounds from alchornea cordifolia. bioactive compounds were identified using several chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques and subsequently evaluated for cytotoxicity and anti-hiv properties. molecular modelling studies against hiv-1 integrase (hiv-1 in) were performed to decipher the mode of action of methylgallate, the most potent compound (ic50 = 3.7 nm) and its analogues from zinc database. cytotoxicity assays showed that neither the isolated compounds nor the crude methanolic extract displayed cytotoxicity effects on the hela cell line. a strong correlation between the in vitro and in silico results was observed and important hiv-1 in residues interacting with the different compounds were identified. these current results indicate that methylgallate is the main anti-hiv-1 compound in a. cordifolia stem bark, and could be a potential platform for the development of new hiv-1 in inhibitors.
introduction acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), remains a significant public health problem with more than 76.1 million people infected since its discovery in 19811,2. according to the 2018 report of the united nations programme on hiv/aids (unaids), about 37 million people are currently living with hiv/aids globally with an estimated 5,000 new infections occurring each day, the majority being in sub-saharan africa3. upon infection, the virus targets host dendritic and cd4+ t cells, subsequently weakening their cell-mediated immunity4. ultimately, this primes the host body systems for attack by a myriad of opportunistic infections and cancers5.presently, there is no cure or effective vaccine for the disease, mainly due to latency and quiescence inherent in the nature of the virus6. however, a customized cocktail of diverse classes of drugs commonly referred to as the highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) is available for the management of the disease7,8. the different haart components suppress the replication of the virus in host cells by targeting different stages of its replication cycle: (i) viral entry (co-receptor antagonists and fusion inhibitors); (ii) viral cdna synthesis [reverse transcriptase (rt) inhibitors]; (iii) viral cdna-host dna integration [integrase (in) inhibitors]; (iv) virion release and maturation [protease (pr) inhibitors]9. despite the considerable success realized hitherto through haart, the continued emergence of cross-resistant viral strains and associated adverse effects of most of the drugs on patients remain significant challenges to a sustained combat against the disease10,11,12,13,14. thus, there is an urgent need for the discovery of novel anti-hiv drug candidates with improved potency, pharmacokinetic profiles and minimal side effects. out of the close to 40 haart drugs approved by the us food and drug administration (fda), only three target hiv-1 in viz. raltegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir8. this deficit was initially linked to the inadequate knowledge on the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism and lack of structural information due to its poor solubility and dynamic nature15. mammalian cells lack functional or structural in homologues, making it a desirable drug target for antiretroviral drug development16,17.the hiv-1 in enzyme is a 288-amino acid protein with three domains: n-terminal domain18 (ntd; residues 1–49); the catalytic core domain (ccd; residues 50–212)19 and the c-terminal domain (ctd; residues 213–288)20. it plays an essential role in the viral replication cycle by covalently integrating pro-viral cdna into the host cell’s chromosomal dna via a two-step sn2 nucleophilic reaction: a 3′-end viral cdna processing and the strand transfer reaction. in the cytoplasm, the enzyme removes two or three nucleotides from the 3′ end of linear pro-viral cdna at the u3 and u5 ends, exposing the active 3′-oh groups forming a pre-integration complex (pic)21. the pic is then imported into the nucleus, and in catalyzes the attack of the exposed 3′-oh groups by phosphate groups of host dna18,19,20,22. the two independent viral cdna integration reactions occur in the ccd and are mediated by a dde motif highly conserved in all retroviruses. mutagenesis experiments involving the asp64-asp116-glu152 catalytic triad residues inactivated the enzyme as well as virus replication23. the asp residues co-ordinate a divalent cation (mg2+ or mn2+) which is an essential cofactor that facilitates a nucleophilic attack on the 3′-oh groups and stabilization of transition states19,24.as part of our effort to identify potential anti-retroviral hits, current work evaluates the hiv-1 in inhibitory properties and cytotoxicity properties of compounds from alchornea cordifolia stem bark using the recombinant form of the enzyme and human hela cells respectively. a. cordifolia is a tropical medicinal plant distributed throughout central, western, eastern and southern africa. its crude extract has been reported to exhibit strong anti-hiv25, anti-bacterial26 and anti-inflammatory27 activities. out of the seven compounds (fig. 1) isolated from a crude methanolic extract (meoh) of a. cordifolia stem bark, methylgallate was found to significantly inhibit hiv-1 in in vitro with an ic50 value lower than that of l-chicoric acid (a known hiv-1 in inhibitor). cytotoxicity assays showed that neither the isolated compounds nor the crude methanolic extract displayed cytotoxicity effects on the hela cell line. to decipher the mode of action of methylgallate and its analogues from the zinc is not commercial (zinc)28 database, molecular modelling studies were performed. a strong correlation between the in vitro and in silico results was observed, and critical hiv-1 in residues interacting with the different compounds were identified. molecular dynamic studies to determine the system stability and flexibility revealed that the different in-ligand complexes investigated in this study were energetically stable. the results presented here indicate that methylgallate is the main anti-hiv-1 compound in a. cordifolia crude extract and could be a potential platform for the development of newer hiv-1 in inhibitors.figure 1chemical structures of isolated compounds (1–7) from a. cordifolia and l-chicoric acid.full size imagemethodsplant identification and collectionfresh stem bark of a. cordifolia was collected from uncultivated farmland on the elounden mountain in the central region of cameroon in january 2010. plant specimens were identified by victor nana, a botanist at the national herbarium of cameroon in yaoundé. a voucher specimen (nos. 40512/hnc) deposited in the same herbarium.extraction and identification of compoundsplant material was dried at ambient temperature and finely ground using a blender. extraction with methanol was performed by maceration for 72 h at room temperature. four liters of methanol was used to extract one kilogram of the dry stem bark resulting to 140 g of crude extract. the crude extract was subjected to vacuum column chromatography followed by several open column chromatography steps to yield the pure compounds according to an already established protocol26.cell viability assaythe cytotoxicity of the crude extract and isolated pure compounds was evaluated by incubating 20 μm of pure compounds and 25 μg/ml of extracts in 96-well plates containing hela (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cells. the cells were maintained in a culture medium made of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) with 5 mm l-glutamine (lonza), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (fbs) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone - psf) for 24 h. cell viability was determined by adding resazurin to a final concentration of 0.09 mm to the cells, incubating for 4 hours and quantifying resorufin fluorescence (excitation560/emission590) in a multiwell plate reader.anti-hiv in assaythe hiv-1 in strand transfer inhibition assay was adapted from previously described methods29. briefly, 20 nm double-stranded biotinylated donor dna (5′-5biotinteg/acccttttagtcagtgtggaaaatctctagca-3′ annealed to 5′-actgctagagattttccacactgactaaaag-3′) was immobilized in wells of streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (r&d systems, usa) by incubation at room temperature for 40 minutes in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 0.05% (v/v) tween 20 and 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (bsa). after a stringent wash step, 5 µg/ml purified recombinant hiv-1 subtype c in in integrase buffer 1 (50 mm nacl, 25 mm hepes, 25 mm mncl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 µg/ml bsa, ph 7.5) was added to individual wells. recombinant hiv-1 subtype c in was assembled onto the pre-processed donor dna through incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature, followed by washing. test compounds and l-chicoric acid were added to individual wells as 10-fold serial dilutions starting at 100 µm. strand transfer was initiated through the addition of 10 nm (final concentration) double-stranded fitc-labelled target dna (5′-tgaccaagggctaattcact/36-fam/-3′ annealed to 5′-agtgaattagcccttggtca-/36-fam/-3′) in integrase buffer 2 (same as buffer 1, except 25 mm mncl2 was replaced with 2.5 mm mgcl2). after an incubation period of 60 minutes at 37 °c, the plates were washed using pbs containing 0.05% tween 20 and 0.01% bsa, followed by the addition of peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-fitc antibody (thermo scientific, usa) diluted 1:1000 in the same pbs buffer. finally, the plates were washed and peroxidase substrate (sureblue reserve™, seracare, usa) was added to allow for detection at 620 nm using a synergy mx (biotek®) plate reader. absorbance values were converted to % enzyme activity relative to the readings obtained from control wells (enzyme without inhibitor). for ic50 determination, dose-response plots of log[compound] vs. % enzyme activity were prepared and ic50 values calculated by non-linear regression analysis. data was fitted to the curve using the least squares method and with a maximum number (1000) of iterations. these calculations were performed, and figures prepared, in graphpad prism (version 5.02).homology modelling, molecular docking and dynamic studieseven with the central function of hiv-1 in, a complete structure of the functional intasome is unavailable. however, structures of the separate domains have been resolved. from the protein database (pdb), the structure of the catalytic core domain (ccd) of hiv-in (pdb id: 1qs4)30 co-crystallised with an inhibitor, 1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(2h-tetrazol-5-yl)-propenone (5-citep) and mg2+ ions as a cofactor was retrieved. the structure has four (141–144) missing residues within the 140 s loop which are crucial for its catalytic function. therefore, 100 model structures were modelled using modeller version 9.1831 with 1qs4 as the template. models had the same amino acid sequence as the recombinant protein used for in vitro hiv-in assays. models were then ranked according to their normalized discrete optimized protein energy (z-dope)32. the top three models were further validated using prosa33, verify3d34, qmean35 and procheck36 and the best quality model selected for docking studies. autodock4.237 was used to determine the interaction and binding affinity of the different compounds. the receptor and compound structure files were prepared in autodock4.2 for docking using a previously established protocol38. the gasteiger-hückel method was used to assign charges on the different ligand and receptor atoms. the mg2+ charge was set at 1.7 as previously determined by the resp method38 and was included in the resulting autodock protein file. a cubic grid box with centre at −18.6, 30.1, 66.6 and size of 60 points along the x, y and z directions with point spacing of 0.375 å was set on the protein. a 100 poses docking simulation run for each ligand was performed using the lamarckian genetic algorithm (lga). the best docked ligand pose was selected based on clustering and with the lowest docking energy score for molecular dynamics (md) simulation studies. a 60% similarity search was then used to retrieve analogues of the best compound from the zinc database. docking studies on these compounds were performed according to the same protocol.seven all-atom molecular dynamics (md) simulations were prepared for the apo in protein and for ligand-protein complexes showing in silico potency with a greater significance than l-chicoric acid. all simulations were performed using the chemistry at harvard macromolecular mechanics (charmm 42) software package39. for each system, 50 ns md simulations were created in a 90 å3 cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. energy minimization was then performed in two stages. the first stage involved the use of a 100 steps of steepest descent minimization in vacuo. the second step was 1,000 steps of adopted basis newton-raphson (abnr) with a tolerance of 0.001. each md system was solvated with tip3p40 water molecules and counter ions were used for neutralization. the solvated system was then minimized using 200 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000 steps of abnr. equilibration of the protein was performed by heating the system from 110 k to 310 k. heating was performed for 100,000 steps using a 1 fs (0.001) time-step. the actual md simulations were performed at constant pressure and temperature (cpt) conditions. each 50 ns simulation was achieved by performing 257 steps using a 0.002 time-step. parameters for describing the protein were obtained from the charmm 36 force field41. due to the presence of a mg2+ ion in the active hiv in, previously determined force field parameters were required to ensure the correct coordination geometry of the active site38. these force field parameters were used to account for the bonds and dihedral angles crucial for the residues coordinating the mg2+ active site. the ligands used in the md simulations were parameterised using the paramchem webserver42 using the charmm general force field (cgenff)43.results and discussion the crude methanolic extract of a. cordifolia stem bark and some of its constituents lack cytotoxicity against hela cellsin vitro viability testing has become an integral step in modern drug discovery as it characterises the toxic potential of a compound and provides predictive evidence of its safety index thus reducing attrition rates in pharmaceutical development44,45. hence, the crude methanolic extract and all the compounds isolated from it (fig. 1) were tested for cytotoxicity against the hela cell line using a resazurin-based cell viability assay. the inherent reducing potential of viable cells converts resazurin to resorufin (detectable by fluorimetry), and is considered as one of the most cost-effective method of determining cytotoxicity46. the activity of untreated hela cells was normalized to 100% activity and all samples were compared to the normalized control. the crude methanolic extract showed no effect on the cell viability (116.1%, fig. 2a). friedelin, o-acetyl-aleuritolic acid, 3-o-acetyl-erythrodiol, stigmasterol, friedelane-3-one-28-al and stigmasta-4,22-diene-3-one also show no significant change in their viability, with mean cell viability values ranging from 102.3% to 118.3% (fig. 2a). for methylgallate it showed a cell viability of 83.77%, which represents a significant reduction in the cell viability compared to all the other compounds as well as the methanol extract (fig. 2a). this indicates that methylgallate does show some toxicity towards the hela cells.figure 2(a) the effects of isolated compounds and crude extract of a. cordifolia on hela cell viability. a vertical box and whisker plot shows the range of cell viability data values (n = 3) and the mean cell viability is marked by the horizontal bar. statistical analyses showed that the data was normally distributed so a one-way anova and a tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed. differences of p > 0.05 are not significant and not shown on the graph. p values between 0.01–0.05 are marked as significant (*), 0.001–0.1 marked as very significant (**) and p < 0.001 marked as extremely significant (***).

with the increased knowledge about the catalytic mechanism of hiv in in the recent past, considerable progress to discover potential inhibitors from natural compounds has been made. the crude methanolic extract and all the isolated compounds from the a. cordifolia methanolic crude extract were tested for anti-hiv in activity. from these samples, 3-o-acetyl-aleuritolic acid, methylgallate, stigmasterol and the crude methanolic extract exhibited activity against hiv-1 in (fig. 2b). the ic50 of the crude extract was found to be 8.5 ng/ml. methylgallate, stigmasterol and 3‐o-acetyl aleuritolic acid exhibited ic50 values of 3.7, 20.5 and 83.7 nm, respectively.interestingly, the ic50 of l-chicoric acid was found to be higher (ic50 = 5.9 nm) than that obtained with methylgallate. thus, methylgallate might be the principle chemical constituent that is responsible for the anti-hiv in activity of the methanolic a. cordifolia stem bark extract. in addition, the isolated compounds were also screened for potency against hiv-1 pr and found to be inactive. from the literature, crude aqueous extract from a. cordifolia seeds has also been shown to possess moderate in vitro inhibitory potency against hiv-1 rt with ec50 values of <0.01–0.03 mg/ml25.methylgallate inhibits hiv-1 in by chelating the active site mg2+ cofactorthe availability of good quality and complete structural information is vital for structure-based drug design and molecular dynamics studies. due to the missing residues in the available hiv in structures in the pdb database, homology modelling was performed with the same target sequence as that of the recombinant protein used in the in vitro hiv-in experiments. a near-native complete structure was obtained with a z-dope score of −1.48 as compared to that of the template (1qs4) of −1.68. z-dope score is an atomic distance-displacement statistical potential that evaluates how close a model is compared to the native structure32,47 with a preferred value of < −0.5. table 1 shows a summary of the validation results from different quality evaluation webservers. all the results gave consistently good quality scores for the top model as to those of the template. figure 3 shows the structural fold of both the template (1qs4) and the top model with a bound inhibitor on the active site as well as the catalytic mg2+.table 1 hiv-1 in ccd best homology model validation results from different structure quality assessment tools.full size tablefigure 3hiv-1 in ccd homology modeling.

one with a hydroxyl group and the other with its alkoxy oxygen of the ester group with asn155. these additional hydrogen bonds might explain its strong interaction of −6.2 kcal/mol compared to methylgallate.figure 4protein-ligand binding pose and interaction. hiv-in complete ccd bound to (a) methylgallate from a. cordifolia and (b) l-chicoric acid and (c) zinc407934. corresponding images show the important residues for coordinating the catalytic mg2+ as well as interacting with the different ligands. shown in blue dotted green lines are hydrogen bonds while the radiating residues show the residues forming hydrophobic interactions. the red loop shows the 140 s loop.full size imageadditional hydrophobic contacts with similar residues common across the different ligands were observed. these residues include cys65, glu152, asn155, lys156, and lys159. of particular interest is the ability of these ligands to interact with the thiol group of cys65 which is known to be an efficient nucleophile as it can be oxidized with ease50. unique to l-chicoric acid was the ability to interact with gln148 found in the 140 s loop facing the active site. this interaction was not observed with the other compounds mainly because of their small size. molecular modeling studies with 5-citep (1qs4 co-crystalized ligand) show similar binding modes as the current ligands and interacted with the identified residues51. a structure-activity relationship study of hiv-1 in inhibitors indicated that for optimum interaction of l-chicoric acid, it has to adopt a pose in which the two aromatic rings form a 90° angle50.additional studies involving md simulations were performed to assess the behaviour of the protein ligand complexes relative to the apoprotein. for each protein system, 50 ns simulations were prepared. the dynamic stability of each protein-ligand complexe was assessed using backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd), root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) and radius of gyration (rg). both the apo and ligand-bound forms of the enzyme displayed similar conformational stability during the molecular dynamic simulations (fig. 5). cα rmsd analysis showed that the systems converged around 3–5 å (angstrom) immediately after equilibration (fig. 5a). additionally, the ligands maintained same poses throughout the md simulations (fig. 5b). a similar observation regarding global stability was made with rg where protein-ligand complexes were found to maintain a radius between 15 and 16 å during simulations (fig. 5c). rmsf calculations were performed to determine the fluctuations within the residues. all the catalytic triad residues and their neighbouring residues were stable (fig. 5d). however, prominent fluctuations were observed in the 140 s loop residues in the apo form and when the protein was bound to methylgallate (fig. 5d). a significant reduction in the fluctuation of this loop was observed when the protein was bound to l-chicoric acid, mainly because of the observed interactions between the ligand and gln148 (fig. 4b). as expected, high fluctuations similar to those in the apo form were observed in the methylgallate, zinc77441, zinc407934 bound proteins as no interaction between these ligands and the 140 s loop were observed.figure 5dynamic properties of both the apo form and ligand bound hiv-in ccd over a simulation period of 100 ns.

Disruption of Timing: NeuroHIV Progression in the Post-cART Era,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36822-1,Research,29 January 2019,yes,"the marked increase in life expectancy for hiv-1 seropositive individuals, following the great success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cart), heralds an examination of the progression of hiv-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (hand). however, since the seminal call for animal models of hiv-1/aids in 1988, there has been no extant in vivo animal model system available to provide a truly longitudinal study of hand. here, we demonstrate that the hiv-1 transgenic (tg) rat, resembling hiv-1 seropositive individuals on lifelong cart, exhibits age-related, progressive neurocognitive impairments (nci), including alterations in learning, sustained attention, flexibility, and inhibition; deficits commonly observed in hiv-1 seropositive individuals. pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) displayed profound synaptic dysfunction in hiv-1 tg animals relative to controls; dysfunction that was characterized by alterations in dendritic branching complexity, synaptic connectivity, and dendritic spine morphology. nci and synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc independently identified the presence of the hiv-1 transgene with at least 78.5% accuracy. thus, even in the absence of sensory or motor system deficits and comorbidities, hand is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by age-related disease progression; impairments which may be due, at least partly, to synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc. further, the progression of hand with age in the hiv-1 tg rat and associated synaptic dysfunction affords an instrumental model system for the development of therapeutics and functional cure strategies.
introduction human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) remains a human health pandemic, with approximately 36.7 million individuals living with the disease worldwide1. older individuals (>50 years of age) account for approximately 30–50% of hiv-1 seropositive individuals in high-resource countries2 following the great success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cart); a prevalence that is expected to reach approximately 73% by 20303. in the post-cart era, milder forms of neurocognitive impairment (nci) have become a hallmark of hiv-1, afflicting between 40–70% of hiv-1 seropositive individuals4,5,6. cross-sectional studies have provided a wealth of knowledge on hiv-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (hand), characterized by deficits in higher-order cognitive processes [e.g., attention, working memory, executive function6,7]. however, extrapolating cross-sectional findings to age-related disease progression is inferentially fraught8, heralding an examination of the progression of hand using a longitudinal experimental design.since the seminal call for animal models of hiv-1/aids9, there has been no extant in vivo animal model system available to provide a truly longitudinal study of hand. the hiv-1 transgenic (tg) rat, originally developed by reid et al.10, contains a gag-pol deleted provirus regulated by the human viral promoter. hiv-1 tg rats exhibit general good health through advancing age, displaying steady growth rates11,12,13, intact sensory (i.e., auditory, visual, gustatory) and motor system function11,14, and a lifespan of approximately 21 months of age11. cross-sectional studies have critically tested the utility of the hiv-1 tg rat as a model for nci; multiple laboratories have reported alterations in temporal processing [e.g.13], sustained attention [e.g.15], learning15,16, and memory17. a longitudinal assessment of nci for the progression of hand, and associated neural mechanisms, in the hiv-1 tg rat, however, remains a critical knowledge gap.thus, in the present study, the hiv-1 tg rat was used to establish the trajectory of nci, in the absence of sensory or motor system deficits14 and comorbidities, across the functional lifespan. it was hypothesized that hiv-1 tg rats, relative to f344/n controls, would display progressive, sex-dependent expression of nci across the function lifespan; impairments that were associated with synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) and/or neuroinflammatory markers in the hippocampus. a longitudinal experimental design was used to assess multiple neurocognitive domains, including learning, sustained attention, flexibility and inhibition, from approximately postnatal day (pd) 60 through pd 600. associated neural mechanisms, including synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc and putative markers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus were also evaluated. the progression of hand with age in the hiv-1 tg rat and associated synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc affords an instrumental model system for the development of therapeutics and functional cure strategies.methodsexperimental designthe experimental design for all neurocognitive assessments and neuroanatomical assessments is illustrated in fig. 1.figure 1schematic of the experimental design.full size imageanimalsacross 12 months, fischer (f344/n; harlan laboratories inc., indianapolis, in) hiv-1 tg (n = 20 litters) and control (n = 17 litters) rats were received at the animal vivarium, between pd 7 and pd 9, housed with their biological dam. at approximately pd 21, animals were sampled from each litter (hiv-1 tg: male, n = 37, female, n = 33; control: male n = 34; female, n = 33), weaned and pair- or group-housed with animals of the same sex for the duration of experimentation.during the original acquisition of signal detection, animals were placed on food restriction, beginning at approximately pd 60, to maintain 85% body weight. after animals successfully acquired the signal detection task (pd 100-pd 277), rodent food was again provided ad libitum, including during all retest assessments. hiv-1 tg and control animals had ad libitum access to water throughout the duration of the study.hiv-1 tg and control animals were sacrificed following the successful completion of the reversal task at approximately 20 months of age to assess synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc and putative markers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. due to health issues, including significant weight loss (n = 23), tumors (n = 6), natural death (n = 3) or other (n = 4), some animals were euthanized prior to 20 months of age.recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health were used for the maintenance of hiv-1 tg and control animals in aaalac-accredited facilities. the targeted environmental conditions for the animal vivarium were 21° ± 2°c, 50% ± 10% relative humidity and a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle with lights on at 0700 h (est). the institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc) at the university of south carolina approved the project protocol (federal assurance # d16-00028).phase 1: original acquisitionapparatussixteen operant chambers, located inside sound-attenuating chambers (med associates, inc., fairfax, vt), were used to train animals in a signal detection task tapping sustained attention. a pellet dispenser (45 mg), located between two retractable levers, and three panel lights were located on the front wall of the operant chambers. only the panel light located above the pellet dispenser was used in the present experiment. a house light was located at the top of the rear wall of the operant chamber. the house light, used for shaping, and central panel light, used for signal presentation during the original acquisition of signal detection and retest assessments, were incandescent (22 lux). pc and med-pc for windows software (v 4.1.3; med associates, inc., fairfax, vt) controlled signal presentation, lever operation, reinforcement delivery, and data collection.shapinga standard shaping response protocol was used to train animals to lever-press at approximately 2 months of age, described in detail by mclaurin et al.18. all animals met criteria in shaping (i.e., 60 reinforcers for 3 consecutive or 5 non-consecutive days), indicating learning the operant response, prior to beginning the signal detection task.signal detectionfollowing successful acquisition of shaping, all hiv-1 tg (n = 20 litters; male, n = 37, female, n = 33) and control animals (n = 17 litters; male n = 34; female, n = 33) were trained in a signal detection task, tapping sustained attention.three vigilance programs, initially described by mcgaughy and sarter19, were employed. in brief, animals were trained to discriminate between signal (i.e., central panel light illumination) and non-signal (i.e., no illumination) trials. in the first vigilance program, consisting of 160 trials per session, termination of the stimulus light was contingent upon a response. in the second vigilance program, consisting of 160 trials per session, the length of the stimulus light was 1 sec. correction trials, including up to three repetitions of the trial, and force-choice trials were an integral component of the first two vigilance programs, and occurred when an animal responded incorrectly. in the third vigilance program, consisting of 162 trials per session, the length of the stimulus was manipulated (i.e., 1000, 500, 100 msec) across trials using a block randomized experimental design. correction trials and force-choice trials were removed in the third vigilance program. during the initial acquisition, no data was censored i.e., each and every animal successfully acquired the signal detection task. a preliminary report of original acquisition, on approximately half of the animals, was presented in mclaurin et al.18. additional methodological details are presented in the supplementary information text available online.phase 2: retest assessmentsapparatusthroughout the retest assessments, hiv-1 tg and control animals were assessed in the operant chambers described above.procedureafter the successful completion of original acquisition, hiv-1 tg and control animals were assessed in the third vigilance program with varying signal durations every 60 days through approximately 18 months of age. animals were given up to 60 days to successfully complete each retest assessment and were assessed in up to 6 retest assessments.phase 3: 18 month assessmentapparatusat the 18 month assessment, hiv-1 tg and control animals were assessed in the operant chambers described above with a minor modification. an led light bulb (11 lux), instead of an incandescent light bulb, was used for signal presentation during the 18 month acquisition and reversal assessment due to the short (i.e., 10 msec) signal duration times.procedureafter the successful completion of the 6th retest assessment or at 18 months of age, hiv-1 tg and control animals were challenged with two tasks. first, hiv-1 tg (n = 20 litters; male, n = 29, female, n = 29) and control animals (n = 17 litters; male n = 28; female, n = 31) were challenged for 5-consecutive days with shorter signal durations (i.e., 1000, 100, 10 msec). second, hiv-1 tg (n = 20 litters; male, n = 18, female, n = 29) and control animals (n = 17 litters; male n = 27; female, n = 28) were assessed in a reversal task, tapping flexibility and inhibition. response contingencies were reversed from those originally learned in the signal detection task. animals were given up to 60 days to successfully complete the reversal assessment or were sacrificed at approximately 20 months of age after 45 days in the task.phase 4: neuroanatomical assessmentssynaptic dysfunctionpreparation of tissue: animals were deeply anesthetized using sevoflurane (abbot laboratories, north chicago, il) and transcardially perfused using methodology adapted from roscoe et al.12.diolistic labeling: a diolisitc labeling technique, originally described by seabold et al.20, was used to visualize pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc). methodology for the preparation of diolistic cartridges, preparation of tefzel tubing, and diolistic labeling is described in detailed by mclaurin et al.21.pyramidal neuron dendritic analysis and spine quantification: pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc, located approximately 3.7 mm to 2.2 mm anterior to bregma22, were analyzed. z-stack images were obtained using methodology previously reported12 on three to four pyramidal neurons from each animal [control: n = 17 litters, male, n = 31, female, n = 30; hiv-1 tg: n = 20 litters, male, n = 35, female, n = 33].the autoneuron and autospine extension modules, available in neurolucida 360 (microbrightfield, williston, vt), were used for the analysis of spine parameters. selection criteria, including continuous dendritic staining, low background/dye clusters, and minimal diffusion of the dii dye into the extracellular space, were used for spine analysis. based on the selection criteria, one neuron from each animal was chosen for the analysis of spine parameters. neurons not meeting the selection criteria were not included in the analysis, yielding control, n = 16 litters, male, n = 26, female, n = 20, and hiv-1 tg n = 19 litters, male, n = 28, female, n = 27.spine parameters: an observer-assisted automatic classification of dendritic spines (i.e., thin, mushroom, stubby) was conducted using an algorithm in neurolucida 36023. the number of segments at each branch order, an assessment of dendritic branching complexity, was examined for branch orders 1 through 10. a sholl analysis was conducted to evaluate neuronal complexity (i.e., the number of intersections at each successive radii) and dendritic spine connectivity (i.e., the number of dendritic spines between each successive radii). some animals were excluded due to processing errors, yielding control, n = 16 litters, male, n = 21, female, n = 18, and hiv-1 tg n = 17 litters, male, n = 26, female, n = 23. subsequently, dendritic spine morphology was assessed using three parameters, including backbone length (µm), head diameter (µm), and volume (µm3). spine parameters were defined using well-accepted previously published results [i.e., backbone length, 0.1 to 4.1 µm24; head diameter, 0 to 0.825 µm25; volume, 0.05 to 0.5 µm3 26].neuroinflammatory markersthe selection of the hippocampus for the assessment of neuroinflammation was based on the publication of fitting et al.27,28, which displayed frank cell loss in the hippocampus from viral protein exposure, maximizing the likelihood of detecting neuroinflammation.total rna isolation and cdna synthesis: total rna was isolated from 30 mg of hippocampal tissue using rneasy ffpe kit (qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol (control: n = 17 litters, male, n = 31 female, n = 30; hiv-1 tg: n = 20 litters, male n = 32, female n = 30). the total rna quality and quantity were assessed by a nano drop spectrophotometer (thermo scientific, usa). one µg of total rna from each sample was converted into cdna by cloned amv first-strand cdna synthesis kit (invitrogen) for real-time pcr. the 20 μl first-strand cdna synthesis reaction mixture contained 1 μl random-hexamer primer, 1 µg total rna sample, 2 μl of 10 mm dntp mix, 5x cdna synthesis buffer, 1 μl of 0.1 m dtt, 1 μl rnaseout, 1 µl cloned amv rt and 1 µl depc-treated water. the following conditions were used: 65 °c for 5 min, 25 °c for 10 min, 50 °c for 50 min and terminated at 85 °c for 5 min. the cdna products were used immediately for further analysis.multiplex pcr (mpcr): initially, hippocampal samples were probed for the expression of tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, nfκ-β and iκ-β, and the internal control, gapdh. cytokine primers, a pcr reaction buffer containing dntps and a positive control were provided in a commercial mpcr kit from maxibio company (rat inflammatory cytokines–set 2, cat. no. mp-70207, san francisco, ca, as previously employed by moran et al.29). however, there was no significant expression of tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, nfκ-β or iκ-β in samples from hiv-1 tg or f344/n control animals. accordingly, we pursued analysis via real-time pcr.real-time pcr: the neuroinflammation related cytokines (tnf-α, il-1β, il-6) were quantified using a real-time pcr detection system and ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix kit (bio-rad). in brief, the 20 μl reaction mixture contained 10 μl 2x ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix, 1 μl forward primer and reverse primers (250 nm each), 1 μl template (100 ng) and 7 μl of depc-treated water. reactions were performed with the dna engine opticon 2 system (m j research, usa) using the following cycling conditions: 30 sec at 95 °c and 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °c and 30 sec at 58 °c. animals failing to reach threshold after 40 cycles were considered to have undetectable gene expression and accordingly these censored data were not included in the figures or statistical analysis, yielding control, n = 8–15 litters, male, n = 7–18, female, n = 8–12, and hiv-1 tg n = 11–13 litters, male, n = 6–14, female, n = 9–15, dependent upon gene. the data were analyzed using intuitive opticon monitor tm software. each primer, including the corresponding genbank numbers, are listed in supplementary table 1, and β-actin was used as an internal control. the relative gene expression of each neuroinflammatory marker (i.e., tnf-α, il-1β, il-6) was analyzed using the 2−δδct method to examine relative changes in expression dependent upon genotype and biological sex30.statistical analysisgiven the nested experimental design (i.e., pups within litter), figures, created using graphpad prism 5 (graphpad software, inc., la jolla, ca), represent litter means and standard errors, dependent upon biological sex31,32.analysis of variance (anova) and regression techniques were used for the analysis of all data (sas/stat software 9.4, sas institute, inc., cary, nc; spss statistics 24, ibm corp., somer, ny; graphpad software, inc., la jolla, ca). for all statistical analyses, litter was used as the unit of analysis to preclude the violation of the assumption of independence, leading to an inflation of type 1 error rate33. orthogonal decomposition of the repeated-measures factors or the conservative greenhouse-geisser df correction factor [pgg34] were used to preclude potential violations of sphericity. effect size was assessed using partial eta squared (ηp2). an alpha value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. additional details on the statistical analyses are available in the supplementary information text.resultsphase 1: original acquisitionthe factor of biological sex was the driving factor for observed differences in the temporal process of acquisition and sustained attention during the initial acquisition of signal detectiontemporal process of acquisition: all hiv-1 tg and control animals were able to successfully acquire the task, achieving 70% accuracy for 5 consecutive or 7 non-consecutive days in each of the three vigilance programs. profound sex differences were observed in the temporal process of task acquisition, best fit using a sigmoidal dose-response curve (fig. 2a; r2s ≥ 0.98). female animals, independent of genotype, acquired the task significantly slower than male animals (main effect: sex [f(1,61) = 101.1, p ≤ 0.001]). presence of the hiv-1 transgene failed to significantly alter the temporal process of initial acquisition of signal detection (fig. 2b; p > 0.05).figure 2initial acquisition of signal detection. (a) assessment of the temporal process of acquisition revealed a main effect of sex (p ≤ 0.001), with female animals, independent of genotype, acquiring the signal detection operant task significantly slower than male animals. (b) genotype failed to alter the temporal process of acquisition during the original acquisition phase (p > 0.05). (c) assessment of sustained attention during the initial acquisition of signal detection revealed that female animals displayed a decreased response rate, as well as a prominent rightward shift in the loss of signal detection (i.e., the intersection of hits and misses; p ≤ 0.001) relative to male animals. (d) presence of the hiv-1 transgene failed to alter sustained attention during initial acquisition (p > 0.05). data are presented as cumulative frequencies with 95% confidence intervals fit to the curve (a,b) or mean ± sem (c,d).full size imagesignal detection: the factor of biological sex (fig. 2c) was the driving factor for observed differences in sustained attention during the initial acquisition of signal detection. female animals, collapsed across genotype, displayed a decreased response rate, as well as a prominent rightward shift in the loss of signal detection (i.e., where the number of hits and misses intersect), relative to male animals (approximately 535 msec vs. 436 msec, respectively; sex × response type × duration interaction [f(2,122) = 74.0, pgg ≤ 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.548, power = 1.0]) with a prominent linear-linear component [f(1,61) = 87.2, p ≤ 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.588, power = 1.0]. in sharp contrast, presence of the hiv-1 transgene failed to alter signal detection during initial acquisition (fig. 2d; genotype × response type × duration interaction [p > 0.05]).phase 2: retest assessmentshiv-1 tg animals, independent of biological sex, exhibited a progressive impairment in task acquisition across retest assessmentdays to criteria: hiv-1 tg and control animals were retested every 60 days in the third vigilance program, which manipulated signal duration length (1000, 500, 100 msec). completion of the retest assessment required animals to meet criteria of 70% accuracy for 5 consecutive or 7 non-consecutive days. to assess the progression of task acquisition across retest assessments, the number of days required for 80% of the population sampled to meet criteria was quantified (fig. 3). control animals displayed a continuous improvement in task acquisition across retest assessments, reaching asymptotic performance at approximately 7 days. in sharp contrast, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited an improvement in task acquisition through retest session 2, followed by a progressive decline. assessment of the temporal process of acquisition at each individual retest assessment (see supplementary fig. 1) revealed a significant main effect of genotype (p ≤ 0.05) at all retest assessments.figure 3the number of days at which 80% of the population sampled met criteria (±95% confidence intervals (ci)) is illustrated as a function of genotype (hiv-1 tg vs. control) and retest session. points and 95% ci were derived from the cumulative frequency curves presented in supplementary fig. 1. control animals exhibited an improvement in performance as a function of retest assessment, reaching asymptotic performance at approximately 7 days. in sharp contrast, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited an initial improvement through retest assessment 2, followed by a progressive decline.full size imagedespite the “savings” afforded by repeated testing, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a progressive, relative impairment in the detection of shorter signal durationssignal detection: across retest assessments, genotype became the driving factor for observed differences in sustained attention. independent of genotype, hiv-1 tg and control animals exhibited a significant improvement in the detection of shorter signal durations across retest assessments (fig. 4). however, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a progressive, relative impairment in the detection of shorter signal durations relative to control animals (genotype × response type × duration × retest assessment interaction [f(8,488) = 2.2, pgg ≤ 0.05, ηp2 = 0.034, power = 0.763] with a prominent quadratic-quadratic component [f(1,61) = 7.3, p ≤ 0.009, ηp2 = 0.106, power = 0.756]). specifically, hiv-1 tg animals took significantly longer to reach the same level of performance (e.g., loss of signal detection at 10 msec: control animals (retest 1); hiv-1 tg animals (retest 5)) and failed to improve to the level of control animals at any retest assessment.figure 4sustained attention as a function of retest assessment. at each individual retest session (i.e, retest 1: (a), retest 2: (b), retest 3: (c), retest 4: (d), retest 5: (e)) hiv-1 tg animals, independent of biological sex, displayed an impairment in the detection of shorter signal durations (1000, 500, 100 msec). across retest sessions, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a progressive, relative impairment in sustained attention (p ≤ 0.05). despite an improvement in the detection of shorter signal durations as a function of retest session, hiv-1 tg animals failed to improve as quickly or to the same magnitude as control animals. data were extrapolated to 10 msec using linear regression calculations to demonstrate the point at which animals experiences a loss of signal detection (i.e., the intersection of hits and misses). a blue line indicates the point at which hiv-1 tg animals experienced a loss of signal detection. data are presented as mean ± sem.full size imagerelative to genotype, the factor of biological sex played a less prominent role in the progression of sustained attention (sex × response type × duration × retest assessment interaction with a prominent linear-linear component [f(1,61) = 5.3, p ≤ 0.025, ηp2 = 0.080, power = 0.622]). female animals, independent of genotype, failed to improve to the same level of performance as male animals.phase 3: 18 month assessmenta more challenging signal detection task at 18 months of age, in combination with a reversal task, tapping flexibility and inhibition, revealed marked impairment, dependent upon task and biological sex, in hiv-1 tg rats relative to control animalstemporal process of acquisition: at 18 months of age, hiv-1 tg and control animals were challenged for 5 consecutive days with shorter signal durations (i.e., 1000, 100, 10 msec). the number of days hiv-1 tg and control animals met criterion was analyzed using a curve-fitting analysis. for male animals, independent of genotype, an exponential growth equation provided a well-described fit (fig. 5a; r2s ≥ 0.98). however, significant differences in the parameters of the function were observed (f(2,15) = 57.4, p ≥ 0.001), indicating a shift in the distribution, with male hiv-1 tg animals meeting criterion on fewer days relative to male control animals. in sharp contrast, a global, exponential growth equation (r2 ≥ 0.96) provided a well-described fit for female hiv-1 tg and control animals (fig. 5b), indicating no significant genotype differences in the number of days meeting criterion during the 18 month acquisition.figure 5temporal process of acquisition during the 18 month acquisition (a,b) and reversal (c,d) task. during the 18 month acquisition task, hiv-1 tg and control animals were challenged for 5 consecutive days with shorter signal durations (i.e., 1000, 100, 10 msec). male hiv-1 tg animals (a) displayed a shift towards a decreased number of days meeting criteria (i.e., 70% accuracy) relative to male control animals (p ≤ 0.001); a distribution shift not observed in female hiv-1 tg animals (b) p > 0.05). the temporal process of acquisition in the reversal task was assessed for hiv-1 tg animals that had two months (i.e., 60 days) to acquire the task. male hiv-1 tg animals took significantly longer to acquire the reversal task relative to male control animals (c) p ≤ 0.005); an impairment not observed in female hiv-1 tg animals (d) p > 0.05). data are presented as cumulative frequencies with 95% confidence intervals fit to the curve.full size imagesubsequently, animals were assessed in a reversal task, tapping flexibility and inhibition. presence of the hiv-1 transgene had a profound effect on the temporal process of acquisition in reversal, dependent upon the factor of biological sex (fig. 5c,d; genotype x sex interaction: [f(1,51) = 4.8, p ≤ 0.033]).complementary analyses were conducted for each sex to determine the locus of the interaction. in male animals (fig. 5c), presence of the hiv-1 transgene significantly altered the temporal process of acquisition with male hiv-1 tg animals acquiring the task significantly slower than male control animals (main effect, genotype: [f(1,26) = 9.5, p ≤ 0.005]). in sharp contrast, presence of the hiv-1 transgene failed to significantly alter the temporal process of acquisition in female animals (fig. 5d; p > 0.05).signal detection: assessment of signal detection data revealed a significant task × response type × duration × genotype × sex interaction [f(2,108) = 7.2, pgg ≤ 0.002, ηp2 = 0.117, power = 0.886] with a prominent linear-quadratic component [f(1,54) = 10.0, p ≤ 0.003, ηp2 = 0.156, power = 0.874].male hiv-1 tg animals revealed marked impairment in signal detection relative to male control animals evidenced by a significant rightward shift in the loss of signal detection during the 18 month acquisition (fig. 6a,c). during the reversal assessment, male control animals displayed a significant increase in both the number of hits and misses, suggesting an overtraining reversal effect. no significant alterations in the number of hits and/or misses was observed in the male hiv-1 tg animals, suggesting that, despite extensive training, there was no improvement in their performance during the reversal task.figure 6signal detection data, presented as mean ± sem, during the 18 month acquisition and reversal task are illustrated as a function of genotype and sex. a significant task × response type × genotype × sex interaction [f(2, 108) = 7.2, pgg ≤ 0.002, ηp2 = 0.117] was observed. male hiv-1 tg (c) animals displayed a profound impairment in the detection of shorter signals during 18 month acquisition task and reversal task relative to male control (a) animals. female hiv-1 tg animals (d) failed to exhibit a deficit in the detection of shorter signals during the 18 month acquisition task relative to female control (b) animals. however, female hiv-1 tg animals exhibited prominent impairments in flexibility and inhibition, evidenced by an inability to reliably detect the signal at any duration assessed during the reversal task.full size imagein sharp contrast, at 18 months of age, female hiv-1 tg animals displayed no impairment in the detection of shorter signal durations relative to female control animals (fig. 6b,d). however, female hiv-1 tg animals, relative to female control animals, exhibited marked impairment in the reversal task evidenced by an inability to reliably detect the signal at any duration assessed.phase 4: neuroanatomical assessmentsselective alterations in neuronal morphology were observed in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex in hiv-1 tg animals, suggesting an alteration in dendritic branching complexity, but not neuronal arbor complexity or dendrite lengthbranch order: a centrifugal branch ordering method was utilized in neurolucida 360 to automatically assign each dendrite with a branch order by counting the number of segments traversed. presence of the hiv-1 transgene had a profound effect on the number of dendritic branches at each branch order (fig. 7a; genotype x branch order interaction [f(1,952) = 10.1, p ≤ 0.002]). specifically, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited an increased relative frequency of dendritic branches at lower branch orders relative to controls, suggesting an alteration in dendritic branching complexity.figure 7two assessments of neuronal morphology, including a branch order analysis (a) and sholl analysis (b) were conducted in pyramidal neurons from the medial prefrontal cortex. branch order analyses (a) revealed an increased relative frequency of dendritic branches at lower branch orders in hiv-1 tg animals relative to controls. in sharp contrast, neither presence of the hiv-1 transgene nor the factor of biological sex influenced the number of dendritic intersections occurring every 10 µm from the soma, assessed using a sholl analysis (b). thus, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited selective alterations in the morphology of pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc, characterized by decreased dendritic branching complexity. data are illustrated as relative frequencies of the entire dataset (a) or mean ± sem (b).full size imagesholl analyses: subsequently, a sholl analysis was conducted as a complementary measure of neuronal arbor complexity, whereby the number of dendritic intersections occurring every 10 µm from the soma were quantified in hiv-1 tg and control animals. neither presence of the hiv-1 transgene nor the factor of biological sex influenced the number of intersections at successive radii (fig. 7b; p > 0.05) or the total dendrite length (p > 0.05; control male: 729.3 ± 83.1 µm, control female: 740.6 ± 49.7 µm; hiv-1 tg male: 679.1 ± 81.0 µm; hiv-1 tg female: 758.4 ± 42.5 µm). thus, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited selective alterations in the morphology of pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc, characterized by decreased dendritic branching complexity.hiv-1 tg animals displayed a profound shift in the distribution of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex, supporting an alteration in synaptic connectivitysholl analyses were subsequently utilized to determine where dendritic spines were located on the neuron, assessed using spine type (i.e., thin spines, stubby spines, mushroom spines), determined using an observer-assisted automatic classification system in neurolucida 360, genotype (i.e., hiv-1 tg, control), biological sex (i.e., male, female) and radii as factors (fig. 8). hiv-1 tg animals exhibited a prominent shift in the distribution of dendritic spines dependent upon the factor of biological sex and spine type (genotype × sex × spine type × radii interaction [f(2, 6265) = 21.5, p ≤ 0.001]). the effect or lack of effect of biological sex on spine type is illustrated in supplementary fig. 2.figure 8the distribution of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons from the medial prefrontal cortex are illustrated as a function of spine type (i.e., thin: (a), stubby: (b), mushroom: (c)), genotype (hiv-1 tg vs. control) and radii. hiv-1 tg animals exhibited a prominent distributional shift in the relative frequency of thin spines (a), with an increased relative frequency on more distal branches, relative to controls. in sharp contrast, hiv-1 tg animals displayed an increased relative frequency of stubby spines (b) on more proximal branches, relative to controls. no genotypic alterations were observed in the distribution of mushroom spines (c). data are illustrated as relative frequencies of the entire dataset.full size imagecomplementary analyses were conducted on each spine type to determine the locus of these interactions. hiv-1 tg animals displayed a prominent shift, with an increased relative frequency of thin dendritic spines on more distal branches relative to control animals (genotype × radii interaction [f(1,2057) = 83.1, p ≤ 0.001]); the magnitude of which was influenced by the factor of biological sex (genotype × sex × radii interaction [f(1,2057) = 19.1, p ≤ 0.001]). in sharp contrast, an assessment of stubby dendritic spines revealed a population shift with an increased relative frequency on more proximal branches in hiv-1 tg animals relative to controls (genotype × radii interaction [f(1,2057) = 14.1, p ≤ 0.001]); an effect influenced by the factor of biological sex (genotype × sex × radii interaction [f(1,2057) = 27.3, p ≤ 0.001]), whereby the effect was observed in female hiv-1 tg animals (genotype x radii interaction [f(1,957) = 50.9, p ≤ 0.001]), but not male hiv-1 tg animals (genotype × radii interaction: p > 0.05). no significant differences in the distribution of mushroom dendritic spines were observed (p > 0.05).a selective population shift in dendritic spine morphology was observed in layers ii-iii pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex dependent upon presence of the hiv-1 transgene and biological sexmeasurement of dendritic spine parameters, including backbone length, head diameter, and volume (see supplementary fig. 3) revealed a selective population shift in dendritic spine morphology in layers ii-iii pyramidal neurons of the mpfc dependent upon presence of the hiv-1 transgene and biological sex. male hiv-1 tg animals exhibited a population shift towards shorter dendritic spines with no observed alterations in head diameter or volume. in sharp contrast, female hiv-1 tg animals displayed a population shift towards longer dendritic spines with decreased head diameter relative to female control animals; no significant alterations in dendritic spine volume were revealed in female hiv-1 tg animals relative to female control animals. a generalized linear mixed effects model with a poisson distribution confirmed these observations, revealing a significant genotype × sex × bin interaction for both backbone length [f(1,1659) = 37.2, p ≤ 0.001] and head diameter [f(1,1154) = 68.2, p ≤ 0.001]; an effect not observed for dendritic spine volume (p > 0.05).there was no significant difference in neuroinflammation in the hippocampus between hiv-1 tg and control animalsthree putative neuroinflammatory markers, including il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α, were assessed in the hippocampus of hiv-1 tg and control animals (fig. 9). overall, hiv-1 tg and control animals, independent of biological sex, reaching threshold after 40 cycles, displayed low levels of gene expression. no significant genotype (p > 0.05) or sex (p > 0.05) differences in gene expression, examined using the 2−δδct method, were observed.figure 9three neuroinflammatory markers, including il-1β (a), il-6 (b), and tnf-α (c), were assessed in the hippocampus of hiv-1 tg and control animals. overall, hiv-1 tg and control animals, independent of biological sex, reaching threshold after 40 cycles, displayed low levels of gene expression; levels which were independent of genotype or sex (p > 0.05). data are presented as mean ± sem.full size imagephase 5: mechanistic basis of neurocognitive impairmentneurocognitive impairments across the functional lifespan explain significant genotypic variancea discriminant function analysis (dfa) was utilized to determine whether neurocognitive assessments conducted across the functional lifespan could classify animals based on genotype (fig. 10a). variables included in the stepwise dfa represented alterations in sustained attention (hits and misses at 1000, 500, and 100 msec during original acquisition and retest 1–5; hits and misses at 1000, 100, and 10 msec during the 18 month assessment), learning (days to criteria during original acquisition, days to criteria at retest 1–5, number of days meeting criteria during the 18 month assessment), and flexibility and inhibition (hits and misses at 1000, 100, and 10 msec during the reversal assessment).figure 10a discriminant function analysis was utilized to determine whether neurocognitive impairments (a) or synaptic dysfunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc; b) could classify animals based on genotype. seven variables, corresponding to alterations in learning and sustained attention, correctly classified the presence of the hiv-1 transgene with 78.5% accuracy, accounting for 61.6% of the genotypic variance in neurocognitive function (a). seven variables, corresponding to alterations in dendritic spine connectivity and dendritic spine head diameter, correctly classified the presence of the hiv-1 transgene with 80.4% accuracy, accounting for 64.6% of the genotypic variance in synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc (b).full size imagehiv-1 tg and control animals were maximally separated (canonical correlation of 0.70) by selecting seven variables corresponding to sustained attention (i.e.,hits at 1000 msec during original acquisition, hits at 500 msec during retest 1, misses at 1000 msec during retest 2, misses at 100 msec during retest 4, hits at 1000 msec during retest 5, and misses at 10 msec during the 18 month assessment) and learning (i.e., days to criteria during retest 5). animals were correctly classified for presence of the hiv-1 transgene (jack-knifed classification) with 78.5% accuracy (approximately of wilks’ λ of 0.516, χ2(7) = 39.4, p ≤ 0.001), accounting for approximately 61.6% of the genotypic variance.synaptic dysfunction, assessed in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the medial prefrontal cortex, explains significant genotypic variancea dfa was utilized to determine whether synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc could classify animals based on genotype (fig. 10b). variables included in the stepwise dfa represented alterations in dendritic branching complexity, dendritic spine connectivity, and dendritic spine morphology.hiv-1 tg and control animals were maximally separated (canonical correlation of 0.72) by selecting seven variables corresponding to dendritic spine connectivity (i.e., relative frequency of thin dendritic spines at 150 µm; relative frequency of stubby dendritic spines at 40 µm, 110 µm, and 170 µm) and dendritic spine head diameter (i.e., relative frequency of dendritic spines within the 0.075 µm, 0.225 µm and 0.375 µm bin). animals were correctly classified for presence of the hiv-1 transgene (jack-knifed classification) with 80.4% accuracy (approximately of wilks’ λ of 0.489, χ2(7) = 32.5, p ≤ 0.001), accounting for approximately 64.6% of the genotypic variance.discussion progressive nci, including alterations in learning, sustained attention, flexibility, and inhibition, were observed in the population of hiv-1 tg rats sampled. during initial acquisition, biological sex was the driving factor for observed differences in learning and sustained attention. across retest assessments, presence of the hiv-1 transgene became the prominent factor underlying alterations in the temporal process of task acquisition, as well as sustained attention. nevertheless, at 18 months of age, sex-dependent expression of nci were observed in hiv-1 tg animals, relative to controls. pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc revealed profound synaptic dysfunction in hiv-1 tg animals relative to controls; dysfunction that was characterized by alterations in dendritic branching complexity, synaptic connectivity, and dendritic spine morphology. nci across multiple domains (i.e., learning, sustained attention) and synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc independently identified the presence of the hiv-1 transgene with at least 78.5% accuracy, accounting for at least 61.6% of the genotypic variance. thus, even in the absence of sensory or motor system deficits14 and comorbidities, hand is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by age-related disease progression; impairments which may be due, at least partly, to synaptic dysfunction in the mpfc.located at the anterior pole of the mammalian brain, the prefrontal cortex (pfc), recognized as an anatomically complex brain region35, is organized in a laminar fashion and comprised of three major subdivisions (i.e., mpfc, orbital pfc (opfc) and lateral pfc). executive functions, including attention, flexibility, and inhibition, are the primary, most basic function of the pfc36. although executive functions cannot be localized to any single subdivision of the pfc, the mpfc, opfc, and lateral pfc each exhibit some degree of functional specialization35,36. specifically, the mpfc has been implicated as having a primary role in attention, including pre-attentive processes [e.g.37] and sustained attention [e.g.38], whereas the opfc is involved in stimulus-reinforcement learning [e.g.39] and reversal [i.e., flexibility and inhibition40].the utilization of a series of neurocognitive tasks across the functional lifespan tapped multiple subdivisions of the pfc, revealing progressive nci in the hiv-1 tg rat. at the genotypic level, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a progressive, relative impairment in tasks tapping both the mpfc (i.e., sustained attention) and the opfc (i.e., stimulus-reinforcement learning). most notably, hiv-1 tg animals also exhibited alterations in the progression of prepulse inhibition, a pre-attentive process tapping, in part, the mpfc14. however, sex differences in the presentation of nci at 18 months of age were dependent upon the brain region tapped via neurocognitive assessments (i.e., mpfc vs. opfc). specifically, male hiv-1 tg animals exhibited significantly greater impairment, relative to male control animals, in sustained attention and stimulus-reinforcement learning in the reversal assessment, tasks tapping both the mpfc and opfc. female hiv-1 tg animals, however, displayed profound impairment, relative to female control animals, in flexibility and inhibition, tasks predominantly associated with the opfc. elucidating the mechanisms underlying sex-dependent expression of nci is vital for the development of therapeutic treatments and cure strategies.the rich cortical and subcortical connections make the pfc ideally positioned to serve as a central hub, integrating and relaying information from multiple afferent sources41. broadly, the pfc receives afferents from thalamic nuclei, the limbic system, the frontal cortex, and other brain regions [e.g., hypothalamus, cerebellum, mesencephalon36]. dense innervation from multiple neurotransmitter systems to the pfc has also been well-established36; afferents which play a prominent regulatory role across the pfc36 and are functionally involved in the control of executive functions [for review42]. specifically, noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus (lc), dopaminergic afferents from the ventral tegmental area (vta), and serotonergic projections from the raphe nuclei innervate the pfc.excitatory pyramidal neurons, characterized by a single apical dendrite, multiple shorter basal dendrites, and thousands of dendritic spines are abundant throughout the pfc43. a synaptic relationship between pyramidal neurons and the major afferent systems is established via postsynaptic sites on dendritic shafts and spines; the vast majority of which occur on dendritic spines [e.g.44]. morphologically, dendritic spines are classically characterized into three primary categories [i.e., thin, stubby, mushroom45]. thin spines, the predominant spine type in both hiv-1 tg and control animals, are characterized by a long, thin neck and a small bulbous head, whereas the head volume to neck volume ratio is higher in mushroom spines. in sharp contrast, stubby spines are devoid of a spine neck, exhibiting an approximately equal head and neck volume ratio45. most notably, asymmetric excitatory synapses are primarily formed between dendritic spine heads and presynaptic axons [e.g.46], however, some dendritic spines receive additional input on their neck47. thus, morphological characteristics of dendritic spines, which are reflective of functionality and capacity for structural change48, and their distribution along the dendrite, may be associated with synaptic dysfunction in the hiv-1 tg rat.neuronal morphology, assessed using a branch order analysis, tapping dendritic branching complexity, as well as the classical sholl analysis, tapping neuronal arbor complexity, revealed prominent alterations in hiv-1 tg animals relative to controls (fig. 11). in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc, assessed in the present study, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited decreased dendritic branching complexity; an effect independent of biological sex. no statistically significant genotypic differences were observed in dendritic length, consistent with previous reports in younger hiv-1 tg animals49 or neuronal arbor complexity. in sharp contrast, in medium spiny neurons (msns) from the nucleus accumbens core subregion (nacc), published results suggest sex-dependent alterations in neuronal morphology50. specifically, female hiv-1 tg animals, but not male hiv-1 tg animals, displayed profound alterations in dendritic branching complexity and neuronal arbor complexity50. morphological differences between pyramidal neurons, characterized as polar neurons, and msns, characterized by a centrifugal morphology, may underlie differences in branch order and sholl analyses. overall, results support alterations in neuronal morphology in hiv-1 tg rats independent of brain region assessed. however, the comparison of results from branch order analyses with those from sholl analyses suggests that the two analytic measures may reflect different measures of neuronal morphology.figure 11dendritic spine connectivity in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex is illustrated as a function of genotype (hiv-1 tg vs. control). pyramidal neurons in hiv-1 tg animals (b) displayed decreased dendritic branching complexity, with a decreased relative frequency of higher order branches relative to control animals (a) with no observed alterations in total dendrite length. control animals exhibited a preponderance of thin spines on more proximal branches, receiving dopaminergic afferents from the ventral tegmental area (vta) and noradrenergic innervation from the locus coeruleus (lc). in sharp contrast, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a preponderance of stubby spines on more proximal branches. morphological characteristics of stubby spines, including the absence of a spine neck45 and decreased postsynaptic density on the dendritic spine head52 suggest that hiv-1 tg animals failed to receive appropriate dopaminergic afferents from the vta and/or noradrenergic innervation from the lc. illustrated here is the reception of dopaminergic and noradrenergic afferents on the dendritic spine neck, although other mechanisms are possible. abbreviations: da: dopamine, dat: dopamine transporter, da1 receptor: dopamine receptor d1, vmat2: vesicular monoamine transporter 2, ne: norepinephrine, net: norepinephrine transporter, α1a receptor: alpha-1a adrenergic receptor, α1d receptor: alpha-1d adrenergic receptor, nmdar: nmda receptor, ampar: ampa receptor, vglut: vesicular glutamate transporter, mglur: metabotropic glutamate receptor, eaat2: excitatory amino acid transporter 2.full size imagehiv-1 tg animals, independent of biological sex, exhibited a profound shift in the distribution of dendritic spines along the apical dendrite, supporting a prominent alteration in synaptic connectivity. specifically, a preponderance of thin spines were observed on more distal dendrites, extending into layer i of the mpfc, in hiv-1 tg animals, relative to controls. however, hiv-1 tg animals, relative to controls, displayed an increased relative frequency of stubby spines on more proximal dendrites; an effect which was most prominent in female hiv-1 tg rats. notably, pyramidal neurons within layers ii-iii of the mpfc express multiple monoamine receptors, including noradrenergic receptors (i.e., primarily α1a, α1d), dopaminergic receptors (i.e., primarily d1) and serotonergic receptors (i.e., primarily 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a); minimal, if any, receptor expression within layer i of the mpfc51. the preponderance of stubby spines, morphologically characterized by the absence of a dendritic spine neck45 and a smaller postsynaptic density52, on more proximal dendrites suggests that hiv-1 tg animals fail to receive afferent projections, and thus neurotransmitter innervation, from the vta, lc, and raphe nuclei (fig. 11); consistent with neurotransmitter system alterations, specifically dopaminergic system dysfunction, commonly reported in hiv-1 [e.g.53,54,55,56]. one previous study49 and one conference abstract57 have also suggested alterations in dendritic spine density in the mpfc in younger hiv-1 tg animals; an effect which may also influence synaptic connectivity. thus, profound synaptic dysfunction was observed in hiv-1 tg animals, characterized by alterations in dendritic branching complexity, synaptic connectivity (i.e., vta-pfc-lc), and dendritic spine morphology, supporting a key neural mechanism for expression of nci in hand.multiple animal systems are available to model components of neurohiv, each with their own advantages and constraints. several major considerations of the prominent animal species and their applicability to provide a biological system to model neurohiv in the post-cart era are highlighted in fig. 12. central nervous system (cns) infection occurs within two weeks of hiv-1 infectivity in humans58,59, leading to nci [e.g.6,7] and behavioral alterations [e.g., apathy60; depression61]. selective nci [e.g., selective attention appears relatively spared15] have been observed across multiple domains in prominent animals systems [e.g., hiv-1 tg rat, pre-attentive processes13; learning and memory16,17; executive function15; siv, spatial working memory62; humanized mice, memory63; tat transgenic mice, spatial learning64,65, reversal learning64]. examples of behavioral alterations, similar to those observed in hiv-1 seropositive individuals, include depressive-like behaviors [e.g., hiv-1 tg rat66; tat transgenic mice67,68] and motivational alterations [e.g., hiv-1 tg rat56]. furthermore, although generally understudied, prominent sex differences in the expression of nci have been observed in hiv-1 seropositive individuals, with hiv-1 seropositive females displaying more severe deficits relative to hiv-1 seropositive males69,70. sex differences in the expression of nci have been translationally modeled in the hiv-1 tg rat18,71,72, but inconsistent results have been reported in other animal systems [e.g., tat transgenic mice73]. given the increased life expectancy of hiv-1 seropositive individuals in the post-cart era, as well as the persistence of nci, an in vivo biological system able to provide a longitudinal study of hiv-1 is critical. hiv-1 seropositive individuals display progressive nci, with individuals exhibiting asymptomatic nci at baseline having an increased risk (i.e., two to six times) of developing symptomatic hand74. the hiv-1 tg rat, as demonstrated in the present study, displays age-related disease progression in multiple neurocognitive domains across the functional lifespan. thus, the present study further elucidates the advantages and constraints of the hiv-1 tg rat biological system to model neurohiv in the post-cart era.figure 12several major considerations of the prominent animal species and their applicability to provide a biological system to model neurohiv in the post-cart era are highlighted.full size imagedespite the aforementioned strengths of the present study, a few caveats are acknowledged. first, the neuronal analysis focused exclusively on pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc. although the generalizability of synaptic dysfunction cannot be directly assessed within the present study, observations across multiple brain regions [i.e., nucleus accumbens, mpfc12,21,49,50], ages [i.e., 4 months; 14–17 months; 20 months12,21,50] and in hiv-1 tg rats following psychostimulant exposure [i.e., methylphenidate21] suggests the importance of further studies investigating synaptic dysfunction as a neural mechanism underlying nci in hand. second, neuroinflammatory markers were assessed exclusively in the hippocampus and using only three cytokines (i.e., il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α). despite the utilization of two experimental methodologies and sufficient statistical power, no significant differences in neuroinflammation in the hippocampus were suggested between hiv-1 tg and control animals; results consistent with those observed using [(18)f]-dpa714 pet imaging and a profile of 24 neuroinflammatory markers in (3 and 9 month) adult hiv-1 tg animals75 and following pd 1 stereotaxic injections of hiv-1 viral proteins [i.e., tat1–86, gp12029]. however, this does not preclude neuroinflammation in the adolescent brain, in other brain regions, or using other methodology [e.g., elisa76]. for example, results of the present study are in contrast to those reported by royal et al.76, which observed significant increases in the expression of inf-γ, tnf-α, and il-β, assessed using elisa, in brain lysates prepared from the frontal cortex and subcortical white matter of the hiv-1 tg rat.even in the absence of sensory or motor system deficits14 and comorbidities, hand is a neurodegenerative disease. nci are characterized by age-related disease progression across multiple neurocognitive domains, tapping two primary subdivisions of the pfc. most notably, alterations in sustained attention and learning across the functional lifespan, account for approximately 61.6% of the genotypic variance in nci, independent of biological sex. synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers ii-iii of the mpfc, characterized by alterations in dendritic branching complexity, synaptic connectivity, and dendritic spine morphology, supports a key, albeit not exclusive, neural mechanism underlying hand, accounting for approximately 64.6% of the genotypic variance. thus, the progression of hand with age in the hiv-1 tg rat and the associated synaptic dysfunction affords an instrumental model system for the development of therapeutics and functional cure strategies.

Comparison of visceral fat measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to computed tomography in HIV and non-HIV,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-019-0073-1,Research,25 February 2019,yes,"background/objectivesindividuals with hiv are susceptible to visceral fat accumulation, which confers an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. advanced software to ascertain visceral fat content from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) has not been validated among this population. we sought to compare dxa with computed tomography (ct) in the measurement of visceral fat cross-sectional area (vat) in hiv and non-hiv using bland–altman analyses.subjects/methodsdata were combined from five previously conducted studies of individuals with hiv (n = 313) and controls without hiv (n = 144) in which paired dxa and ct scans were available. in cross-sectional analyses, dxa-vat was compared with ct-vat among participants with and without hiv. in longitudinal analyses, changes in vat over time were compared between dxa and ct among participants with and without hiv receiving no intervention over 12 months and among individuals with hiv receiving tesamorelin—a medication known to reduce vat—over 6 months.resultsin hiv, dxa underestimated vat compared with ct among individuals with increased visceral adiposity. the measurement bias was −9 ± 47 cm2 overall, but became progressively larger with greater vat (p < 0.0001), e.g., −61 ± 58 cm2 among those with vat ≥ 200 cm2. sex-stratified analyses revealed that the relationship between vat and measurement bias was especially pronounced in men (p < 0.0001). longitudinally, dxa underestimated changes in vat, particularly among those at the extremes of vat gain or loss (p < 0.0001). in contrast to the cross-sectional findings, the tendency for dxa to underestimate longitudinal changes in vat was evident in both men and women. analogous findings were seen among controls in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.conclusion sdxa underestimated vat relative to ct in men with and without hiv, who had increased visceral adiposity. dxa also underestimated changes in vat over time in men and women, irrespective of hiv status. dxa-vat should be used with caution among both hiv and non-hiv-infected populations.
introduction independent of body mass index (bmi), fat distribution is an important determinant of cardiometabolic health1. specifically, visceral fat has been associated with hypertension2,3, dyslipidemia3,4, glucose intolerance3,4, and coronary artery disease5,6. on the other hand, subcutaneous fat has been generally regarded as a benign storage depot3,4,7. among individuals with hiv, visceral fat accumulation is commonly observed, even at a normal or overweight bmi8,9. moreover, consonant with findings from the general population, hiv-related changes in fat distribution have been shown to confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease10,11,12.in hiv and in the general population, there is a critical need for a safe, affordable, and accurate method to quantify visceral fat. such an approach would allow for the routine clinical use of visceral fat measurement to stratify cardiovascular risk and to monitor the efficacy of metabolic interventions. the gold standard for abdominal adipose tissue measurement is computed tomography (ct)13. in this regard, visceral fat cross-sectional area at the l4 vertebral level (ct-vat) has been widely adopted due to its strict relation to skeletal landmarks and thus high degree of reproducibility (r = 0.99)13,14. however, as ct involves radiation exposure and is costly, alternative means to assess visceral fat have been sought15.dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) is an inexpensive imaging modality that uses minimal radiation to quantify regional fat distribution (e.g., total abdominal or truncal fat)16,17,18. in recent years, advanced software has enabled visceral fat cross-sectional area to be ascertained in a predominantly automated manner from a standard dxa scan (dxa-vat)19. multiple studies among the general population have demonstrated that dxa-vat approximates vat as measured by other imaging modalities including ct15,19,20,21. however, the accuracy of dxa-vat has not been evaluated among individuals with hiv, who may exhibit substantial expansion of this depot. moreover, the use of dxa to quantify changes in visceral fat over time (i.e., in response to an intervention) has never before been assessed among any patient population.in the current analysis, we leveraged data from previously conducted clinical studies to compare dxa-vat with ct-vat among a large sample of men and women with and without hiv. specifically, we sought to assess the accuracy of dxa in the measurement of (1) visceral fat at a single time point, (2) changes in visceral fat over time that occur spontaneously, and (3) changes in visceral fat over time that occur in response to an intervention. before dxa-vat can be readily applied in clinical and research settings, it is pivotal to validate its accuracy in diverse populations and to delineate potential limitations to its use.subjects and methodssubjectswe combined all available data from five studies of individuals with hiv, which were conducted from 2006 to 2014 (supplementary table 1)22,23,24,25,26. in each study, participants recruited from the boston area underwent abdominal ct and dxa concurrently per protocol. controls without hiv were co-enrolled in three of the studies and their data were included for comparison22,23,25. in four of the studies, participants were followed longitudinally for at least 6 months with ct and dxa repeated at fixed intervals23,24,25,26.in our cross-sectional analysis, we compared dxa with ct in the measurement of visceral fat among individuals with and without hiv at a single time point. each participant contributed one set of paired ct and dxa data to this analysis (supplementary fig. 1). for subjects who took part in more than one study, only baseline data from their first longitudinal study was included for analysis. if no longitudinal data was available, data from the cross-sectional study was used. we prioritized inclusion of baseline longitudinal data in the cross-sectional analysis to facilitate consistency between the cross-sectional and longitudinal sub-studies.in our longitudinal analysis, we sought to determine the accuracy of dxa compared with ct with respect to repeated measurements of visceral fat over time. this analysis consisted of two arms (supplementary fig. 1). first, we devised a natural history group, which comprised participants with or without hiv, who had been assigned to receive either no treatment or placebo for at least 12 months23,25,26. changes in visceral fat from baseline to 12 months as measured by dxa and ct were compared. as with our cross-sectional analysis, for subjects who had participated in more than one longitudinal study, only data from their first study was eligible for inclusion. second, we assembled a group of individuals with hiv, who had been randomized to receive tesamorelin or placebo for 6 months24. tesamorelin is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh) analog that selectively reduces visceral fat without substantially altering subcutaneous fat content or bmi27,28. as such, this randomized trial enabled us to assess the agreement between dxa and ct with regard to an intervention known to reduce visceral fat. we included all participants of this study, who had dxa and ct data available at baseline and 6 months.subjects gave informed consent before their participation in study procedures. the institutional review boards at massachusetts general hospital and/or massachusetts institute of technology approved each original study and the current combined analysis.study proceduresin each of the five studies, all participants underwent a detailed history and physical exam. hiv viral load and t-cell subsets were performed using standard assays. at baseline, whole-body dxa (hologic qdr 4500 a, hologic discovery a, and hologic horizon a) was performed and analyzed by licensed research dieticians certified as bone densitometry technologists by the international society for clinical densitometry. in addition, at baseline, each subject underwent a single-slice ct scan of the abdomen at l4 level (general electric, waukesha, wi) for assessment of vat and subcutaneous adipose tissue area (sat). in four of the five studies, repeated dxa and ct were performed at set intervals of 6 or more months among participants receiving either treatment, placebo, or no intervention.ct scan was performed with participants in the supine position. lateral and frontal scout images were obtained to identify the l4 vertebral level, which served as a landmark for the single-slice scan. scan parameters were standardized: 144 table height, 80 kv, 70 ma, 2 seconds scan time, 1 cm slice thickness, 48 cm field of view. a single expert (m.t.) supervised the reading of all scans to ensure uniformity. quantification of abdominal fat depots was performed using image analysis software (vitrak, merge/efilm, inc., chicago, il). briefly, thresholding methods were applied to identify adipose tissue using a threshold set to −50 to −250 hounsfield units. then, manual delineation with tools provided by the software was used to separate vat from sat. pixels within the threshold that were not anatomically one of the two adipose tissue depots were removed. using this technique, the coefficient of variation for repeated measurements of the same scan on consecutive days by the same analyst has been reported as 2.3% for vat and 1.7% for sat20.for the purposes of the current analysis, dxa was re-analyzed by a single research dietician (j.h.) in 2018 using hologic horizon a, apex 6.6.0.5 software (hologic, inc., bedford, ma, usa) for measurement of visceral fat cross-sectional area. standard procedures per the horizon bone densitometry systems user guide were employed29. briefly, for each scan, the software automatically located the outer and inner margins of the abdominal wall in a 5 cm region of the abdomen. the lower border of this region coincided with the l4 vertebral level and marked the plane through which dxa-vat cross-sectional area was reported. the software measured total abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat directly, and reported visceral fat content as the difference between these measurements20,30. to assess the reproducibility of our dxa-vat readings, 98 dxa scans were re-analyzed by a second research dietician (t.h.). owing to the high level of automaticity of the apex software, there was a strong correlation (r > 0.99) of dxa-vat measurements between readers. both dieticians were kept blind to the ct data.statistical analysisin our comparisons of dxa vs. ct, individuals with and without hiv were analyzed separately. for the cross-sectional analysis, the correlation between ct-vat and dxa-vat was determined using pearson’s correlation coefficient. measurement bias was calculated as the mean difference between the two techniques (dxa–ct) ± sd. bland–altman plots were subsequently used to display the relationship of average vat between modalities vs. measurement bias31. visual inspection followed by linear regression was used to assess for systematic bias. multivariable models also were constructed to adjust for age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and to test for interactions of vat with age (≥ vs. <50 years), sex, race, bmi (≥ vs. <30 kg/m2), cd4 count (≥ vs. <250 cells/mm3), hiv viral load (≥ vs. <50 copies/ml), and antiretroviral therapy (art) duration (≥ vs. <5 years), and class (among individuals receiving art). for interactions that were significant, subgroup analyses were performed. a comparable statistical approach was used to compare dxa with ct with respect to sat.for the natural history longitudinal analysis, a linear regression was performed to relate change in ct-vat to change in dxa-vat over 12 months. multivariable models were constructed to compare the changes in vat between these two modalities, while controlling for age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and to test for an interaction between sex and change in vat. changes in vat as measured by dxa and ct also were compared using a bland–atlman plot. an analogous statistical approach was taken for the tesamorelin longitudinal analysis, which compared changes in visceral fat as measured by ct and dxa over 6 months among individuals with hiv only.all two-group comparisons used student’s two-tailed t-test assuming unequal variances for continuous outcomes and χ2-test for categorical outcomes. continuous variables were reported as mean ± sd or mean (95% confidence interval). a critical value of p < 0.05 was used to designate statistical significance. all statistical analyses were performed using jmp pro 12.0.1 (sas institute, inc., cary, nc).resultsclinical characteristicsa total of 313 individuals with hiv and 144 controls were included in these analyses (table 1). participants with and without hiv were similar in age (48 ± 7 vs. 47 ± 7 years) and racial distribution. individuals with hiv tended to have long-standing infection (15 ± 7 years) that was well controlled (viral load < 50 copies/ml in 76%) on art (88%).table 1 baseline characteristics in hiv and non-hiv groupsfull size tablealthough bmi was comparable between hiv and non-hiv groups (27 ± 5 vs. 28 ± 5 kg/m2), fat distribution varied as would be expected8,32. in particular, individuals with hiv had higher ct-vat (141 ± 101 vs. 115 ± 84 cm2, p = 0.004) and lower ct-sat (236 ± 137 vs. 289 ± 152 cm2, p = 0.0005) than controls. total abdominal adiposity did not differ between groups.cross-sectional comparison of dxa with ct in hivamong individuals with hiv, ct-vat and dxa-vat were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) (fig. 1a). moreover, dxa-vat only mildly underestimated ct-vat on average (−9 ± 47 cm2, p = 0.001) (table 2). however, the difference between these modalities (dxa–ct) became progressively more negative with greater visceral fat content (p < 0.0001) (fig. 1a). as such, the measurement bias was 7 ± 29 cm2 among individuals with vat < 200 cm2, compared with −61 ± 58 cm2 among those with vat ≥ 200 cm2 (p < 0.0001).fig. 1: comparison of dxa and ct for cross-sectional vat and sat measurement in hiv.a in hiv, there is a strong correlation between ct and dxa in the measurement of vat (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001), although the regression line (shown with 95% confidence bands) deviates from the dotted line of unity (p < 0.05). the bland–altman plot for vat demonstrates that measurement bias (dxa–ct) is progressively more negative with greater visceral fat content (p < 0.0001). horizontal dotted lines denote the mean difference between dxa and ct, as well as the expected 95% limits of agreement. measurement bias in individuals with the most severe visceral fat accumulation is not contained within the scope of these lines. b there is a strong correlation between ct and dxa in the measurement of sat (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001). unlike vat, the regression line (shown with 95% confidence bands) does not differ from the dotted line of unity. the bland–altman plot for sat demonstrates that dxa overestimates sat consistently across the subcutaneous fat spectrum. horizontal dotted lines denote the mean difference between dxa and ct, as well as the expected 95% limits of agreementfull size imagetable 2 comparison of visceral fat area measured by dxa and ctfull size tablesex-stratified analyses revealed contrasting relationships of dxa-vat with ct-vat in men vs. women. clinical characteristics between men and women with hiv were compared in supplementary table 2. on average, dxa-vat underestimated ct-vat among men, whereas it overestimated ct-vat among women (−20 ± 50 vs. 14 ± 27 cm2, p < 0.0001) (table 2). the relationship between visceral adiposity and measurement bias (dxa–ct) also differed between sexes as evidenced by a significant sex × vat interaction (p < 0.0001) in models that adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. when each sex was analyzed separately, the line relating vat average (dxa and ct) to vat difference (dxa–ct) had a slope of −0.41 (−0.47 to −0.36) in men and −0.09 (−0.17 to −0.003) in women (fig. 2). thus, dxa progressively underestimated vat as a function of visceral fat content in men, whereas this relationship was less pronounced in women.fig. 2: sex differences in vat measurement bias in hivsex-stratified analyses reveal that the inverse relationship between visceral adiposity and measurement bias (dxa–ct) in hiv is predominantly driven by men (p < 0.0001). in the bland–altman plot shown, the line for men (blue squares) has a slope of −0.41 (−0.47 to −0.36), whereas the line for women (red circles) has a slope of −0.09 (−0.17 to −0.003). accordingly, dxa most substantially underestimates vat among hiv-infected men with visceral fat accumulation. linear regression lines are shown with 95% confidence bandsfull size imagein addition, in hiv, obesity did not modify the inverse relationship between visceral adiposity and measurement bias (dxa–ct). however, at any given visceral fat content, the measurement bias was modestly smaller in obese compared with non-obese individuals (supplementary fig. 2). there was no effect or interaction with vat for age, race, cd4 count, hiv viral load, or art duration or class (among participants receiving art) in relation to measurement bias.in hiv, ct-sat and dxa-sat were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001) (fig. 1b) with an overall measurement bias (dxa–ct) of 55 ± 48 cm2 (p < 0.0001). unlike visceral fat, the bias did not substantially vary across the subcutaneous fat spectrum (fig. 1b). however, among individuals with high visceral fat in whom dxa routinely underestimated vat, dxa conversely overestimated sat (fig. 3). thus, sat bias (dxa–ct) became increasingly more positive as a function of visceral adiposity (p < 0.0001), although it did not systematically relate to subcutaneous fat content per se.fig. 3: reciprocal relationship between vat and sat measurement bias in hivamong hiv-infected individuals, dxa progressively underestimates vat (red circles) in proportion to visceral fat accumulation (p < 0.0001). conversely, dxa increasingly overestimates sat (blue squares) as a function of visceral adiposity (p < 0.0001). linear regression lines are shown with 95% confidence bandsfull size imagelongitudinal comparison of dxa with ct in hiva total of 106 individuals with hiv who were followed for at least 12 months on no active treatment were included in the natural history analysis. the linear relationship between change in ct-vat and change in dxa-vat over 12 months had a slope of 0.55 (0.45–0.65), indicating that dxa systematically underestimated ct with respect to change in vat over time (fig. 4a). as such, among the subset of participants who had a decline in ct-vat at 12 months compared with baseline (n = 46), change in ct-vat was −27 ± 28 cm2, whereas change in dxa-vat was −15 ± 24 cm2. similarly, among the subset of participants who had a gain in ct-vat over 12 months (n = 60), change in ct-vat was 23 ± 21 cm2, compared with change in dxa-vat of 13 ± 20 cm2. unlike the sex differences seen in the cross-sectional analysis, sex did not modify the relationship between change in ct-vat and change in dxa-vat over 12 months in a model that adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. the tendency for dxa to underestimate changes in vat also was evident in a bland–altman plot, in which the measurement bias was largest at the most extreme gains and losses of vat (fig. 4a). in this regard, measurement bias (dxa–ct) was negative among individuals who had a gain in vat and positive among individuals who had a loss of vat (p < 0.0001).fig. 4: comparison of dxa and ct for longitudinal vat measurement in hiv.a in the natural history analysis of individuals with hiv, changes in vat over 12 months by ct and dxa are well-correlated (r = 0.74, p < 0.0001). however, the regression line (shown with 95% confidence bands) deviates from the dotted line of unity (p < 0.05) such that dxa underestimates a gain or loss of vat as measured by ct. the bland–altman plot comparing changes in vat over 12 months between dxa and ct is also shown. measurement bias (dxa–ct) is positive among individuals with vat loss and negative among individuals with vat gain (p < 0.0001), which again suggests that vat gain and loss are both underestimated by dxa. horizontal dotted lines denote the mean difference between dxa and ct in change in vat over time and the expected 95% limits of agreement. measurement bias between dxa and ct does not differ between men (blue squares) and women (red circles). b the tesamorelin analysis similarly shows that dxa underestimates changes in vat over 6 months relative to ct. the extent of underestimation is comparable between individuals treated with tesamorelin (red circles) or placebo (blue squares)full size imagewe next examined subjects with hiv, who had been assigned to receive tesamorelin (n = 23) or placebo (n = 20) for 6 months in a randomized-controlled trial. analogous to the natural history analysis, among the tesamorelin-treated participants, the linear relationship between change in ct-vat and change in dxa-vat had a slope that was significantly <1 (0.29, 0.01–0.57). in this group, over 6 months, the change in ct-vat was −33 ± 46 cm2, whereas the change in dxa-vat was −12 ± 31 cm2. when the placebo-treated participants from the original randomized-controlled trial were included in the model, treatment assignment did not modify the relationship between change in ct-vat and change in dxa-vat over time (fig. 4b). the bland–altman plot of the data from the tesamorelin trial was comparable to that seen in the natural history analysis (fig. 4b).comparison of dxa to ct in controls without hivthe comparison between dxa and ct in controls without hiv yielded similar findings to those seen in hiv. there was a strong correlation between ct-vat and dxa-vat (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001) (supplementary fig. 3) and only a modest bias of dxa compared with ct overall (1 ± 40 cm2) (table 2). however, as in hiv, the measurement difference between modalities (dxa–ct) became progressively more negative with greater visceral adiposity (p < 0.0001) (supplementary fig. 3). in addition, once again, men predominantly drove this relationship with a significant sex × vat interaction in a model that adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity (p < 0.0001) (supplementary fig. 4). lastly, although there was no obesity × vat interaction, the magnitude of the measurement bias was slightly smaller in obese compared with non-obese individuals across the spectrum of visceral adiposity (supplementary fig. 2).a total of 80 controls without hiv were included in the longitudinal analysis. as in hiv, the linear regression relating change in ct-vat to change in dxa-vat over 12 months had a slope that was <1 (0.51, 0.39–0.62), suggesting that dxa underestimated longitudinal changes in vat compared with ct (supplementary figure 5). this relationship was not modified by sex in a model that adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity.discussion in the current work, we used data from five previously conducted studies of participants with and without hiv, to assess the accuracy of dxa in the automated measurement of vat. in our cross-sectional analysis of individuals with hiv, we showed that dxa underestimated vat relative to ct among those with high visceral fat content. sex-stratified comparisons revealed this measurement bias was largely driven by men rather than women, even upon controlling for vat. in our longitudinal assessment of participants with hiv, we found that dxa underestimated changes in vat over time, irrespective of sex. analogous findings were demonstrated in cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons among controls without hiv.to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the accuracy of dxa-vat specifically among individuals with hiv. people living with hiv as a group are prone to visceral fat accumulation due to an interplay of medication toxicities, viral effects on host metabolism, and contemporary lifestyle trends33,34. moreover, hiv lipodystrophy is an extreme form of visceral fat accumulation that remains common among long-term survivors35 or those with drug resistance, who require older-generation therapies36. visceral fat accumulation is a key mediator of cardiometabolic comorbidities in hiv such as glucose intolerance12,37, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease38, and coronary artery disease39. accordingly, our group developed the ghrh analog tesamorelin as a novel strategy to selectively reduce visceral fat in hiv without substantially altering subcutaneous fat or bmi27,28. as anticipated, a reduction in visceral fat with tesamorelin has been associated with metabolic benefits including decreased triglycerides40 and liver enzymes41 among this patient population. tesamorelin is the only medication that has been approved by the food and drug administration to treat excess abdominal fat in hiv.given the pivotal contribution of visceral fat accumulation to cardiometabolic risk in hiv, a technique that allows for the safe, affordable, and convenient measurement of visceral fat may substantially improve the quality of care among the hiv population. despite the initial promise of dxa in this regard, we found that this modality systematically underestimated vat among participants with hiv and visceral fat accumulation compared with ct. of note, sex-specific comparisons revealed that men rather than women were predominantly responsible for this relationship. in contrast to vat, the measurement difference for sat between dxa and ct did not substantially vary across the subcutaneous fat spectrum. however, for the individuals in whom dxa underestimated vat, dxa conversely overestimated sat. our findings were analogous for controls without hiv, although the range of visceral fat content examined was narrower among this group.multiple studies from the general population have posited that visceral fat quantification by dxa is accurate compared with ct and magnetic resonance imaging (mri)15,19,20,21,42. however, in several of these reports, the sample was limited to women20,21. concordant with these studies, our data suggest that dxa is relatively accurate in women with and without hiv, even among those with increased visceral adiposity.moreover, consonant with our findings in men with and without hiv, several previous studies have shown that dxa loses accuracy with greater visceral adiposity15,42,43. in addition, multiple prior reports have found a tendency for dxa to underestimate visceral fat compared with other modalities43,44. in one such study of older males, visceral fat volume as measured by dxa was consistently 30% less than that measured by mri44. of note, the authors of this previous work attributed this bias to a difference in compartment sizes between modalities rather than to a true measurement inaccuracy44. similarly, a study among korean men and women found that dxa underestimated visceral fat volume relative to ct as a function of visceral adiposity43. sex-stratified analyses were not performed in this previous study43. a higher proportion of visceral fat is common to men45 and asians46 relative to women and other races, respectively, which may account for the more pronounced measurement bias seen among these groups.strategies to reduce visceral fat have been developed for the clinical care of individuals with hiv as a means toward improving metabolic health. however, to our knowledge, the accuracy of dxa with respect to detecting changes in visceral fat over time has never before been assessed. in the current analysis, among individuals with and without hiv receiving no intervention for 12 months, we found that dxa systematically underestimated changes in vat as measured by ct, irrespective of sex. we additionally showed that dxa underestimated changes in vat over 6 months among individuals with hiv that were randomized to receive tesamorelin or placebo. among the tesamorelin-treated participants, the average vat reduction as measured by dxa was <50% of that measured by ct.strengths of this analysis include its large sample of individuals with and without hiv. furthermore, both men and women were included in our analysis, which allowed for us to draw important sex-specific distinctions between groups. in addition, we assessed longitudinal changes in dxa-vat over time both in the presence and the absence of a metabolic intervention. an important limitation to our analysis is that dxa-vat was exclusively determined using a hologic scanner and apex software. although this lends consistency to our comparisons, we were not able to assess the accuracy of dxa-vat as ascertained by other systems. similarly, our analyses compared dxa and ct with respect to visceral fat cross-sectional area, but did not evaluate visceral fat volume or mass. measurement of visceral fat volume by ct was not performed in our original studies to minimize the dose of radiation to which participants were exposed. nonetheless, as visceral fat cross-sectional area is highly correlated with visceral fat volume on ct (r > 0.95)47, we would expect a comparison of this parameter between modalities to yield similar findings. however, further research is needed to confirm this.in the current study, we showed that dxa underestimated visceral fat content among men with and without hiv, who had increased visceral adiposity. we also demonstrated that dxa underestimated changes in visceral fat content over time among both men and women, irrespective of hiv status. these findings represent important caveats to the use of dxa for the automated determination of visceral fat. dxa-vat should be

Fibrogenic Gene Expression in Hepatic Stellate Cells Induced by HCV and HIV Replication in a Three Cell Co-Culture Model System,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37071-y,Research,24 January 2019,yes,"retrospective studies indicate that co-infection of hepatitis c virus (hcv) and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) accelerates hepatic fibrosis progression. we have developed a co-culture system (mlh) comprising primary macrophages, hepatic stellate cells (hsc, lx-2), and hepatocytes (huh-7), permissive for active replication of hcv and hiv, and assessed the effect of these viral infections on the phenotypic changes and fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells. we detected distinct morphological changes in lx-2 cells within 24 hr post-infection with hcv, hiv or hcv/hiv in mlh co-cultures, with migration enhancement phenotypes. human fibrosis microarrays conducted using lx-2 cell rna derived from mlh co-culture conditions, with or without hcv and hiv infection, revealed novel insights regarding the roles of these viral infections on fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells. we found that hiv mono-infection in mlh co-culture had no impact on fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells. hcv infection of mlh co-culture resulted in upregulation (>1.9x) of five fibrogenic genes including ccl2, il1a, il1b, il13ra2 and mmp1. these genes were upregulated by hcv/hiv co-infection but in a greater magnitude. conclusion : our results indicate that hiv-infected macrophages accelerate hepatic fibrosis during hcv/hiv co-infection by amplifying the expression of hcv-dependent fibrogenic genes in hsc.
introduction hepatic fibrosis is a consequence of an abnormal wound healing response to chronic liver injury, characterized by excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins1. the major cell types in the liver inducing hepatic fibrogenesis include hepatic stellate cells (hsc), hepatocytes and macrophages (kupffer cells)2,3,4,5. following chronic injury, quiescent hsc residing in the perisinusoidal space of disse receive signals secreted by damaged hepatocytes, macrophages and other immune cells and undergo rapid activation into myofibroblast-like cells5. these cells migrate and accumulate at the sites of tissue repair, secrete pro-fibrogenic cytokines and transform into myofibroblasts expressing alpha smooth muscle actin (αsma) and secreting large amounts of ecm proteins. this leads to disruption of equilibrium between deposition and dissolution of ecm proteins, promoting liver fibrogenesis and potentially leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc)1,6.hepatitis c virus (hcv) induces host antiviral immune responses leading to chronic inflammation that promotes hepatic fibrogenesis7,8,9. hcv-infected hepatocytes were shown to release transforming growth factor β1 (tgf-β1), one of the most potent pro-fibrotic cytokines3, which modulates the hsc expression of several key genes involved in liver fibrosis10,11,12. besides the indirect effects of hcv on hsc function through infected hepatocytes, hcv proteins were shown to directly trigger hsc activation by modulating signaling and metabolic pathways13,14.due to a shared route of transmission via infected human blood, hcv and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) co-infections are relatively common with estimated 2.3 million people living with hcv/hiv co-infection globally15. several studies have demonstrated that hiv infection accelerates hcv infection-mediated hepatic fibrosis progression16,17. the pathogenesis of accelerated hepatic fibrosis among hiv/hcv coinfected persons is still unclear but likely complex and may include multiple factors such as direct viral effects, immune/cytokine dysregulation and augmented oxidative stress12,18,19.different in vitro approaches have been developed to mimic hepatic microenvironment to better understand the pathogenesis of hcv infection or hcv/hiv co-infection-mediated hepatic fibrosis. one such system was hsc monoculture incubated with heat inactivated hcv, hiv or conditioned medium from these virus infected cells12,20. however, monoculture systems may not recapitulate the cross talk between different hepatic cell types. other studies employed a hsc/hepatocyte bi-culture system to study the mechanism of hepatic fibrosis caused by hcv21 or hiv/hcv co-infection18, respectively. although these bi-culture model systems support hcv infection due to inclusion of hepatocytes, they lack macrophages (mφ), the primary cell type supporting hiv replication. therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a three-cell co-culture system allowing cell-cell communication between three major cell types in the liver playing central roles in hepatic fibrosis development, including hsc, hepatocytes (permissive for hcv infection) and primary mφ (permissive for hiv infection), in order to understand the role of hcv/hiv co-infection in accelerating the hepatic fibrosis by activating hsc. our study revealed that active replication of hiv in mφ amplified the selective fibrogenic signals in hsc induced by hcv replication in hepatocytes under three cell co-culture condition in a mφ-dependent manner.resultsestablishment of a novel, co-culture model system consisting of three cell types involved in hepatic fibrosis, and supporting hcv and hiv co-infectioncurrently, an in vitro model system that represents the hepatic microenvironment permitting active hcv/hiv co-infection is not available. in an effort to determine the role of these viral replications on hepatic fibrosis progression, we have developed a three-cell co-culture system consisting of hcv-infected hepatocytes (huh-7, human hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell line widely used in hcv research field for its high permissiveness to hcv infection22), hiv-infected primary macrophages (mφ), and hepatic stellate cells [lx-2, an immortalized line of human primary hsc23] as schematically shown in fig. 1a. in brief, primary human monocyte-derived mφ were infected with hiv24 and then co-culture was established by addition of huh-7 cells, with or without hcv infection, as well as lx-2 cells. these cells (mφ, lx-2 and huh-7 or mlh co-culture) were maintained in 2% human serum in emem (eagle’s minimum essential medium) up to 9 days, since longer duration of cultures caused cell death. we determined the survival of all three cell types during 9 day co-culture period by performing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis (fig. 1b,c). to facilitate detection of lx-2 cells, these cells were labeled with the carboxyfluorescein n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (cfse, fluorescent cell staining dye) [(lx-2(cfse)]. we first verified the specific detection of lx2(cfse) and cd68-immunostained mφ by using facs detectors fl1 and fl4, respectively, using each of individual cell types (fig. 1b). then we detected the lx-2(cfse) and cd68-immunostained mφ as well as non-fluorescent huh-7 cells on day 9 of co-culture by facs analysis (fig. 1c). these results indicate that all three cell types in mlh co-culture could survive up to 9 day of co-culture. importantly, we detected the replication of hiv and hcv as evidenced by detection of hiv p24 and hcv core antigen for the duration of mlh co-culture (fig. 1d,e).figure 1development of three cell co-culture system (mlh) permissive for hcv and hiv

(c) lx-2 cell morphology under mlh co-culture at day 7 detected using a fluorescent and phase-contrast microscope.full size imagehcv/hiv co-infection of mlh culture for 7 days did not affect overall lx-2 cell proliferationwe have measured the rate of lx2(cfse) cell proliferation, by determining the fluorescence intensity of cfse levels, to be ~three divisions during 7-day culture period, regardless of whether lx-2 cells were cultured singly or under mlh co-culture condition in a transwell setting (fig. 3a).next, we determined the effect of hiv or hcv infection, or hcv/hiv co-infection, on lx2(cfse) cell proliferation and morphology change under mlh co-culture/transwell setting following 7-day co-culture. as shown in fig. 3b, overall lx-2 cell proliferation was not affected by hcv and hiv mono- or co-infection of mlh co-culture. however, fraction of lx-2 cells showing stellate morphology in hiv and or hcv/hiv co-infected mlh co-cultures retained higher levels of cfse compared to cells showing a “round” morphology, indicating a reduced rate of proliferation (fig. 3c, white arrowheads). also, lx-2 cells from hcv/hiv co-infected mlh co-cultures showed a higher incidence of an elongated and flattened myofibroblast-like morphology (fig. 3c, red arrowheads). this myofibroblast-like morphology in lx-2 cells was also detectable from hcv-infected mlh co-cultures, although less frequently. the mixed presence of the lx-2 cell population, showing both quiescence-associated stellate morphology and proliferation-associated myofibroblast-like morphology in hcv/hiv co-infected mlh co-culture (fig. 3c, see also the review by anthony et al.28), likely resulted in the lack of significant net effect of hcv/hiv infection on lx-2 cell proliferation (fig. 3b). in summary, these results suggest that co-infection of hcv/hiv induced distinct, mixed morphological and proliferative phenotypic changes in lx-2 cells under mlh co-culture condition.hiv/hcv co-infection augmented the hcv infection-dependent upregulation of selected fibrogenic genes in lx-2 cells under mlh co-culture conditionsto assess the effect of hcv and hiv mono- or co-infection on fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells, we isolated total rna from lx-2 cells cultured in transwell mlh co-culture conditions in the presence and absence of hcv and/or hiv infection, and then subjected these rnas to human fibrosis microarray analysis (fig. 4a). initial assessment indicated that the effects of viral infection in mlh co-culture on fibrogenic gene expressions in lx-2 cells became evident by day 7 post-co-culture (supplementary fig. s1a). therefore, we performed all subsequent microarray experiments by using lx-2 cell rnas collected on day 7 to 8 of mlh co-cultures (generated by using 7 different primary mφ) in the presence or absence of hcv and or hiv infection. the results of these experiments were following: after hcv mono-infection, five genes, including c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 (ccl2), interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (il13ra2), interleukin 1α (il1a), interleukin 1β (il1b) and matrix metalloprotease 1 (mmp1) were upregulated, on average, more than 1.9 fold in lx-2 cells during mlh co-culture. (fig. 4b, red fill). however, their upregulations were not statistically significant as shown in volcano plot (fig. 4d, red dots). interestingly, these same genes were also upregulated by hcv/hiv co-infection but in greater magnitude (fig. 4b, green fill) and statistically significant manner (fig. 4e, green dots). on the contrary, hiv mono-infection showed no impact on fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells under equivalent conditions (fig. 4b, black fill. see also fig. 4c). clustergram shown in supplementary fig. s1b summarizes the relatedness between hcv infection- and hcv/hiv co-infection-mediated changes in fibrogenic gene expression patterns in lx-2 cells from mlh co-culture, compared to no infection, as well as lack of obvious changes by hiv infection. in general, primary mφ from different donors had minimal to moderate variation in most fibrogenic gene expression levels in lx-2 cells during mlh co-cultures regardless of viral infection (fig. 5a, see also supplementary fig. s2). however, profound variations in the expression levels of above-mentioned, five selective genes in lx-2 cells were detected following infection of hcv or hcv/hiv to different mlh co-cultures differing only by their primary mφ content (fig. 5a,b).figure 4hcv/hiv co-infection augmented the induction of specific fibrogenic genes upregulated by hcv in mlh co-culture system.

co-culture system (mlh) consisting of three major cell types in the liver involved in hepatic fibrosis development, including primary mφ, hsc (lx-1) and hepatocytes (huh-7), permissive for active replication of hcv and hiv. we have determined the effects of hcv and hiv on early phenotypic changes in hsc to understand the viral mechanisms triggering hsc activation and resulting in hepatic fibrosis. our results indicated that hcv and/or hiv replication in mlh co-cultures trigger morphological changes in hsc and enhanced the invasive potential of hsc (fig. 2). importantly, hiv mono infection in mlh co-culture had no impact on fibrogenic gene transcriptions in hsc, while co-infection of hcv/hiv significantly augmented the expression of hcv-responsive fibrogenic genes in hsc, including ccl2, il1a, il1b, il13ra2 and mmp1 (figs 4 and 5), providing mechanistic insight into enhanced fibrogenesis in hcv/hiv co-infected patient population compared to those infected with hcv alone.use of different primary mφ in our mlh co-culture system provided us with a perspective regarding the role of different mφ for upregulation of fibrogenic genes in hsc upon hcv and/or hiv infection. interestingly, expression of the majority of fibrogenic genes in hsc showed limited variations between mlh cultures generated by using mφ from different donors, regardless of hcv and/or hiv infection under our experimental condition (figs 5a and s2). however, in the case of five selective genes upregulated 1.9 fold or more on average by hcv or hcv/hiv co-infection, the magnitude of these gene inductions in hsc varied substantially depending on different primary mφ used (fig. 5a,b). it is likely that differences in individual phenotypes of mφ contributed to this variation, since previous studies suggested that hcv-dependent induction of m2-polarized mφ promoted hsc activation and hepatic fibrosis25,31,32. interestingly, we detected no correlation between hiv replication levels (represented by p24 levels in fig. 1d) and altered fibrogenic gene expression folds in lx-2 cells following hiv infection of different mlh co-culture (fig. 5a). these results suggest that divergent primary mφ phenotypes following hiv infection, not the hiv replication efficiency per se, determined the magnitude of hcv/hiv co-infection-dependent fibrogenic gene expression in lx-2 cells under mlh co-culture condition. future studies are needed to determine the mφ phenotypes that will trigger high level of fibrogenic gene expression in hsc following hcv or hcv/hiv co-infection. such information could be useful to identify patients at higher risk of developing hepatic fibrosis following these viral infections.theoretically, hiv-infected mφ could have directly modulated fibrogenic gene expression in hsc regardless of hcv infection or induced a different set of genes from those induced by hcv in the coinfection condition and thereby accelerate hepatic fibrosis in hcv/hiv co-infection cases. however, by performing microarray analysis of 84 genes involved in human fibrosis using hsc specific rna samples obtained from mlh co-culture system, our study eliminated either of these possibilities. instead, our data showed that hcv/hiv co-infection augmented fibrogenic gene expression in hsc compared to hcv mono infection, consistent with previous report18. however, different from this previous study18, we did not detect the effect of hiv on fibrogenic gene expression in hsc. differences in experimental strategies such as hsc/hepatocytes exposed to hiv in the previous study versus mlh that include primary mφ infected with hiv in our study, may have caused this discrepancy.under our experimental conditions, well-known fibrogenic genes, including αsma (acta2), isoforms of collagenase (col1a2 and col3a1), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp, except timp1), and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp, except mmp1) were not induced in lx-2 cells by hcv and hiv mono- and co-infection of mlh co-cultures (figs 6 and s2). despite this, we detected myofibroblast-like morphological changes in fraction of hsc from hcv infected or hcv/hiv co-infected mlh co-culture at 7 days post co-culture indicating that those hsc may have undertaken an activation process (fig. 3c).it is notable that substantially upregulated fibrogenic genes in hsc by hcv or hcv/hiv infection of mlh co-culture belong to inflammatory cytokines, including ccl2, il1a, il1b and il13ra2. the ccl2, also called monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp1), is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by hsc and kupffer cells in the liver, and promotes hepatic fibrosis by stimulating the recruitment of monocytes to the injured liver33,34. based on our data, we propose that significant upregulation of ccl2 in hsc under hcv/hiv co-infection condition likely contributed to enhanced fibrosis development, in addition to previously suggested immuno-pathological mechanism of ccl2 for accelerating hcv/hiv co-infection-mediated liver fibrosis35.il1a and il1b constitute two forms of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1. previous studies suggested il1a as an early responder of inflammatory response and il1b as a late responder, recruiting neutrophils and mφ, respectively, to the site of injury36. il1 receptor knockout mice were protected from hepatic fibrosis development indicating the critical roles of these two cytokines in this process37. our data indicate that significant upregulation of il1a and il1b from quiescent hsc due to hcv/hiv co-infection might be an early inflammatory response contributing to enhanced hsc activation leading to hepatic fibrosis.il13ra2 was shown to be overexpressed in activated hsc, and blocking the il13 receptor reduced hepatic fibrosis development caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash)38. our data indicate that hcv infection could promote il13ra2 expression in hsc, which could be further upregulated by hiv co-infection, supporting the role of this factor in accelerated hepatic fibrosis by hcv/hiv co-infection.matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) degrade extracellular matrix and play critical roles in tissue repair and remodeling. different mmps were implicated to function differently based on their substrate specificity, and environment in which they are expressed, not only in ecm remodeling but also in immune responses39. over expression of mmp-1, mmp-8 and mmp-13 was shown to reduce the number of activated hsc and attenuate the hepatic fibrosis when transiently over expressed in the liver40,41,42,43. these findings suggest the protective role of mmps during liver injury. however, evidence for profibrotic roles of mmps also exist44. since hcv-dependent mmp-1 induction in hsc was augmented by hiv co-infection, we speculate that mmp1 induction in hsc could have a potential to play a profibrotic role.hcv-infected hepatocytes and hiv-infected mφ were separated from hsc via transwell during our three cell co-culture condition. therefore, soluble factors from hcv and hiv infected hepatocytes and mφ must have contributed to the induction of fibrogenic genes in hsc. one such candidate is tgf-β1, which plays a pivotal role during tissue fibrosis development45, since hcv replication in huh-7 cells was shown to induce this cytokine46,47,48. however, the study by schulze-krebs indicates that tgf-β1accounted for only ~50% of profibrogenic activity derived from hcv replicating cells, suggesting the presence of additional mediators induced by hcv replication48. interestingly, recent literature idicates the important role of tgf-β2 in hepatic stellate cells activation and liver fibrogenesis, potentially even more so than the role of tgf-β1 in this process49,50,51. chida et al. showed that silencing of tgf-β2 in hcv-infected huh-7 cells reduced fibrogenic phenotypes in the human hepatic stellate cell line twnt4 in two cell co-culture study. importantly, they showed that serum tgf- β2 levels in hcv-infected patients positively correlated with hepatic fibrosis stages f0-f2. supporting this finding, a recent study by abd el-meguid et al. also demonstrated positive correlations between hcv infection-associated hepatic fibrosis and elevated tgf-β2 level in serum and peripheral leucocytes51. our preliminary data showed the significantly higher tgf-β2 levels in supernatant of mlh co-culture following hcv/hiv-co-infection compared to no infection (supplementary fig. s3). these results suggest that tgf-β2 may be one of the main drivers of hcv/hiv-co-infection mediated upregulation of fibrogenic genes in hsc. however, further studies are necessary to establish the exact role of tgf-β2 in hcv/hiv co-infection mediated acceleration of hepatic fibrosis development. also effort should be directed to identify any additional, soluble profibrogenic factors responsible for activating hsc during hcv/hiv co-infection, since such biomarkers could serve as a diagnostic tool to detect hepatic fibrosis induction or a potential target of therapeutic interventions to inhibit fibrosis development following these viral infections.one of the limitations of this study is that our in vitro system does not include other residential liver components, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells, which were shown to contribute to hepatic fibrosis development52. additional limitations may be the small number of primary mφ that we used to generate mlh co-cultures, which limited the representation of mφ characteristics from free-range, out bred human population. despite these limitations, the three-cell mlh co-culture system, for the first time, allowed us to determine the effects of active replication of hcv and hiv in hepatocytes and mφ, respectively, on fibrogenic gene expression in hepatic stellate cells associated with hepatic fibrosis development.in conclusion , we showed that hcv infection in hepatocytes trigger key fibrogenic factors in hsc, including proinflammatory cytokines as well as factors involved in tissue remodeling leading to activation of hsc. hiv infection in mφ, while having no impact on fibrogenic gene expression in hsc, specifically augmented hcv-dependent fibrogenic factor induction in hsc. we believe that our data provided mechanistic insight into accelerated hepatic fibrosis by hcv/hiv co-infection, which is hiv-dependent amplification of hcv-mediated hsc activation.methodscell lines and culture conditionsthe huh-7 cell line was derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma and expressed α-fetoprotein (afp)53 without any evidence of viral infection. this cell line has been widely used in hcv reserch field for its high permissiveness to hcv infection22. huh-7 cells were maintained in dmem with 10% fbs at 37 °c in 5% co2 conditions. lx-2 cells are immortalized primary human hepatic stellate cell line, and were purchased from emd millipore and maintained in dmem with 2% fbs at 37 °c in 5% co2 conditions according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.monocytes cultureperipheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated from healthy human donors under the utmb institutional review board (irb)-approved protocol, by density gradient centrifugation over ficoll. informed consent was obtained from all participants. purified monocytes were resuspended and cultured in medium consisting of iscove’s modified dulbecco’s media (imdm) supplemented with 2% human ab serum (invitrogen, madison, wi), 1% penn-strep at 37 °c in 5% co2 conditions, then differentiated to macrophages by incubating them for 7 days in complete medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml gm-csf.transwell co-culturefor co-culture experiments, primary macrophages (+/−hiv) and huh-7 cells (+/−hcv) were placed in hanging cell inserts of 6 well transwell (corning incorporated, acton, ma, 0.4 µm pore size) at a seeding density of 1 × 105/well and 2.5 × 105/well, respectively. lx2 cells were labeled with cfse (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succininyl ester). briefly, lx2 cells were incubated with cfse (5um) for 20 min at 37 °c, then washed twice with pbs, once with dmem (10% fbs) and finely incubated with dmem (2% fbs). cfse-labeled lx-2 cells were seeded on top of matrigel layer in bottom well at a seeding density 5 × 104/well. the co-culture media conditions were optimized based on our strategy to ensure the balanced survival of all three cell types during co-culture period lasting 7 to 9 days. we chose to use primary macrophage culture medium (imdm, 2% human serum and 1% penn-strep) to reduce the relative over growth of lx-2 cells and huh-7 cells in comparison to non-dividing primary macrophages. original seeding numbers of different cell types were determined based upon the growth rates of huh-7 and lx-2 cells to give the most biologically relevant ratio of cell numbers possible throughout the duration of co-culture under in vitro experimental condition54,55.transwell invasion assaylx2 were seeded in the hanging insert of transwell plate (0.8 µm pore size), which were pre-coated with

Hexamethylene bisacetamide impairs NK cell-mediated clearance of acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and HIV-1-infected T cells that exit viral latency,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40760-x,Research,13 March 2019,yes,"the hexamethylene bisacetamide (hmba) anticancer drug was dismissed due to limited efficacy in leukemic patients but it may re-enter into the clinics in hiv-1 eradication strategies because of its recently disclosed capacity to reactivate latent virus. here, we investigated the impact of hmba on the cytotoxicity of natural killer (nk) cells against acute t lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) cells or hiv-1-infected t cells that exit from latency. we show that in t-all cells hmba upmodulated micb and ulbp2 ligands for the nkg2d activating receptor. in a primary cd4+ t cell-based latency model, hmba did not reactivate hiv-1, yet enhanced ulbp2 expression on cells harboring virus reactivated by prostratin (pro). however, hmba reduced the expression of nkg2d and its dap10 adaptor in nk cells, hence impairing nkg2d-mediated cytotoxicity and dap10-dependent response to il-15 stimulation. alongside, hmba dampened killing of t-all targets by il-15-activated nk cells and impaired nk cell-mediated clearance of pro-reactivated hiv-1+ cells. overall, our results demonstrate a dominant detrimental effect of hmba on the nkg2d pathway that crucially controls nk cell-mediated killing of tumors and virus-infected cells, providing one possible explanation for poor clinical outcome in hmba-treated cancer patients and raising concerns for future therapeutic application of this drug.
introduction natural killer (nk) cells are the major component of the innate immune system endowed with the capacity to recognize and kill virus-infected and transformed cells without prior antigen encounter. the function of nk cells is regulated by the net balance of opposite signals delivered by activating and inhibitory receptors that bind cognate ligands on the surface of target cells1. upon viral infection or transformation, a cell usually loses human leukocyte antigen class i (hla-i) molecules that function as ligands for inhibitory receptors and, simultaneously, upregulates ligands of activating receptors, hence becoming a target for nk cell-mediated lysis. the antitumor function of nk cells has been exploited in several clinical trials to treat cancer patients by means of nk cell adoptive transfer in either autologous or allogeneic settings2,3,4,5. however, therapeutic success can be affected by disease relapse in some patients, especially in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) or other hematological malignancies. this is why combination of nk cell-based immunotherapy with chemotherapeutic agents or other drugs that boost expression on tumor cells of ligands for nk-cell activating receptors is under investigation as novel anticancer strategy6,7.among nk cell activating receptors, the nk receptor group 2 member d (nkg2d) plays a key role in the recognition of both tumors and infected cells. in humans, nkg2d is expressed by all nk and cd8+ t cells and by subsets of γδ t cells, nkt cells, and cd4+ t cells, and recognizes several ligands (nkg2dls): the major histocompatibility complex i-related chain a and b proteins (mica and micb) and ul16 binding protein 1–6 (ulbp1-6)8. expression of nkg2dls requires activation of nf-κb and other transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, and activation of the dna damage response (ddr) pathway, henceforth is highly restricted in normal tissues but can be induced during viral infection and tumor transformation9. ligand binding by nkg2d results in phosphorylation of a receptor-associated adaptor, dnax-associated protein 10 (dap10), followed by engagement and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-k) and downstream signaling molecules that potently stimulate nk cell-mediated elimination of virus-infected cells and tumors10,11. the importance of nkg2d-mediated response of nk cells against cancer has been demonstrated by immunogenetic, clinical and experimental studies12, also corroborated by the evidence that most anticancer drugs, including antimetabolic agents, antitumor antibiotics, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci), upmodulate nkg2dls on tumor cells7. moreover, nkg2d has a key role in infectious diseases, given that cells respond to most viral infection by upregulating nkg2dls and, notwithstanding various mechanisms evolved by viruses to restrain nkg2dl cell-surface expression, they become targets for nkg2d-mediated recognition and killing by nk cells, as clearly demonstrated for hiv-1-infected cd4+ t cells13. recently, we proposed that the nkg2d/nkg2dls axis could be exploited to clear latent hiv-1 reservoirs persisting in infected patients despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (art), which represent a major drawback in the fight against hiv-114. actually, the ultimate ‘shock-and-kill’ approach to hiv-1 eradication implies administration of viral latency reversing agents (lras) that reactivate silent provirus, associated with the killing of cells harboring reactivated virus by the host immune system15. candidate lras belong to different functional categories given that various mechanisms contribute to the establishment and maintenance of hiv-1 latency, including epigenetic silencing of the viral promoter and sequestration in inactive complexes of factors required for viral transcription initiation (i.e. nf-κb) and elongation (i.e. positive transcription elongator factor b, p-tefb)16,17. to date, clinical trials in which lras have been administered to art patients demonstrated modest or no clearance of hiv-1 reservoirs despite reactivation of viral gene expression, hence adjuvant immune-based strategies are being evaluated18,19,20. of note, most lras under investigation have been used in tumor immunology studies and clinical trials for non hiv-1-related diseases because of their capacity to upregulate nkg2dls9,21, indicating that latent hiv-1 and nkg2dls are under the control of common regulatory pathways. as a matter of fact, we recently showed that two candidate lras with hdaci or protein kinase c agonist (pkca) activity (i.e. saha and prostratin -pro-, respectively) can simultaneously induce/derepress latent hiv-1 and nkg2dls14,22. in addition, we and others have shown that il-15 potently boosted nkg2d expression and cytotoxicity of nk cells against t cells that exit viral latency, suggesting that combining lra administration and immunotherapy with il-15-activated nk cells represents a promising approach towards hiv-1 eradication14,23.aside their capacity to upmodulate nkg2dls, candidate drugs with anticancer and/or lra properties should be carefully tested for their direct effect on immune effector cells. indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that some therapeutic agents, particularly hdacis, induce the downregulation of nkg2d and other activating receptors on nk cells and, more in general, can decrease nk or cd8+ t cell viability and/or cytotoxicity against tumors or infected target cells24,25,26,27,28,29.in the present study we thoroughly investigated the impact on the nkg2d/nkg2dl axis of hexamethylene bisacetamide (hmba), a prototype hybrid bipolar compound with both anticancer and lra features. hmba was initially developed as an anticancer drug based upon its ability to induce differentiation and growth arrest of various transformed cells, including promyelocytic leukemia, breast cancer, colon carcinoma, and melanoma cells30. in transformed cells, hmba leads to cell cycle arrest in g0/g1, loss of proliferative capacity, and also, in some tumor cell lineages, apoptotic cell death31. these events have been associated with hmba-induced changes affecting proteins that regulate the cell cycle (e.g. prb, p53, e2f), anti-apoptotic factors (e.g. bcl-2, notch1), and pkc32,33,34,35. on the basis of in vitro evidences, hmba has entered into clinical trials for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome36,37. however, the lack of significant hematologic improvement in hmba-treated patients has hampered further testing of this drug in oncologic trials. the interest in hmba was recently renewed because of its reported capacity to reactivate latent hiv-1 via activation of p-tefb and elongation of viral transcripts38,39. specifically, hmba was shown to disrupt the inactive complex in which p-tefb is sequestered through activation of ca2+ signaling and of pp2b and pp1α phosphatases40, as well as via pi3-k stimulation38. hmba can also stimulate initiation of hiv-1 transcription, albeit with a modest effect41. thus, the use of hmba in combination with pkca such as pro, which are known to activate nf-κb signaling pathway, is under investigation as a potential strategy to reduce the size of latent hiv-1 reservoir42,43.here we assessed the effects of hmba on nkg2dl expression in both acute t lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) cells and in hiv-1-infected cd4+ t cells that exit from viral latency, as well as on the phenotype and function of nk cells. we show that, notwithstanding a stimulatory effect on nkg2dl expression on target cells, hmba downmodulates nkg2d in nk cells, hence inhibiting their cytotoxicity against t-all cells and t cells harboring reactivated hiv-1. moreover, nk cells exposed to hmba display low dap10 levels and do not respond to il-15 stimulation. these results indicate that hmba can exert a detrimental effect on nk cells in the context of cancer therapies or ‘shock-and-kill’ approach to hiv-1 eradication.resultshmba upmodulates nkg2dls on t-all cellsto investigate the impact of hmba on nkg2dl expression in tumor cells, we selected three cell lines derived from patients with acute t lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all): jurkat, cem, and molt-4. after 18 h culture with or without the addition of hmba at a 5 mm concentration that is not toxic and optimal for inducing differentiation of transformed cells44, cells were analyzed by facs for the surface expression of four nkg2dls (mica, micb, ulbp1, and ulbp2) as well as of pvr (cd155), a nectin-like molecule that is frequently upregulated in tumors and functions as ligand for another nk-cell activating receptor, dnam-145. as expected, we did not observe losses in cell viability upon hmba treatment (fig. 1a). with the exception of mica that was barely detectable in cem and molt-4 cells, all tested nkg2dls were expressed in the three cell lines (fig. 1b), consistent with the presence of at least one of these molecules on leukemia cells of most patients46,47. upon hmba exposure, the three cell lines demonstrated a significant ~2-fold increase in micb and ulbp2 expression levels, while mica was only minimally augmented and ulbp1 was either not affected or, only in molt-4 cells, slightly decreased (fig. 1b,c). moreover, the basal expression of pvr, which is elevated in jurkat and molt-4 cells and absent in cem cells, did not change following hmba treatment (fig. 1b). thus, although restricted to micb and ulbp2, the upmodulation of nkg2dl by hmba has the potential to enhance t-all cells killing via nkg2d+ cells.figure 1hmba induces nkg2dl expression on leukemia t cells. three t lymphoblastoid cell lines, jurkat, cem and molt-4, were cultivated for 18 h in medium alone (not treated, nt) or in the presence of 5 mm hmba and then analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability and measure the cell-surface expression of nkg2dls and pvr. (a) the percentage of dead+ cells among nt (filled grey histograms, grey percentages) and treated cells (open histograms, black percentages) is shown. (b) histograms show the fluorescence distribution of cells labeled with mabs against mica, micb, ulbp1, ulbp2, and pvr in a representative experiment. dashed line, filled gray histogram, and solid line represent staining with isotype control igg, nt, and hmba-treated cells, respectively. the mfi values for nt cells (gray) and hmba-treated cells (black) are indicated. (c) nkg2dl expression, both % of positive cells and mfi, was determined as shown in panel a in 3 independent experiments. whiskers box analysis shows median (bar), 25th–75th percentile (box), and minimum and maximum (vertical lines) values. *p < 0.05 by wilcoxon matched-pairs test.full size imageimpact of hmba on nk cell phenotypenext, we examined the effects of hmba on nk cells. first, primary nk cells isolated from healthy donors were cultivated for 18 h with or without 5 mm hmba, then analyzed by flow cytometry. we found that hmba did not affect nk cell viability and had no effect on the expression of the cd69 activation marker or on cd107a that measures degranulation activity (fig. 2a,b). these results are in line with a previous report showing that markers of cell activation (i.e. cd69, cd25, cd38, hla-dr) or proliferation (i.e. ki67) did not change in pbmcs upon treatment with hmba48. we then assessed the expression of six activating receptors that regulate nk cell cytotoxic responses, including nkg2d, dnam-1, the nkp46, nkp44, and nkp30 natural cytotoxicity receptors (ncrs), and the cd16 (fcgriii) fc receptor that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc). this analysis was performed following 18 h culture with or without hmba in the presence or absence of il-15, a physiologic stimulus of nk cell activity. exposure to hmba alone caused a significant decrease in the expression of nkg2d in terms of frequency of nkg2d+ cells and nkg2d mfi, while other receptors were not affected (fig. 2c). as expected, nk cells responded to short-term il-15 stimulation by upregulating both nkg2d and nkp4414,22, but not in the presence of hmba. thus, in nk cells hmba suppresses cell-surface nkg2d expression and abrogates both nkg2d and nkp44 upmodulation induced by il-15.figure 2hmba downmodulates nkg2d on nk cells. (a) the purity of nk cells isolated from pbmcs was examined by flow cytometry measuring the frequency of cd3−cd56+cd16+/− cells. (b,c) nk cells were cultured for 18 h in medium alone (nt) or supplemented with 5 mm hmba and examined for the expression of various markers: (b) the percentage of dead+, cd69+ and cd107a+ nk cells among nt (filled grey histograms, grey percentages) and treated cells (open histograms, black percentages) is shown together with control igg signal (dashed line) for a representative experiment; (c) both the % of positive cells and mfi for nkg2d, dnam-1, nkp46, nkp44, nkp30, and cd16 are shown for nk cells nt and treated with hmba and/or 12.5 ng/ml of il-15. experiments were performed with at least 5 independent donors. bars represent mean ± sem. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by two-tailed paired t test.full size imagenkg2d downregulation by hmbato gain insights into nkg2d downregulation by hmba, we analyzed nkg2d turnover at the nk cell membrane, which is the major mechanism through which expression of this receptor is regulated49. by analyzing various time points, we found that nkg2d downmodulation by hmba was a slow phenomenon, starting around 6 h post-treatment and reaching a maximum after 18 h (fig. 3a). next, we performed a facs-based endocytosis assay triggered by anti-nkg2d antibody, showing that the rate of nkg2d internalization was maintained in nk cells treated for 18 h with hmba if compared to untreated cells (fig. 3b). moreover, by immunolabeling intracellular nkg2d in nk cells treated with hmba and il-15, either alone or in combination, we found that the extent of nkg2d expression within hmba-treated cells reflected that observed at the plasma membrane (fig. 2c), with a 2-fold reduction that occurred with or without simultaneous addition of il-15 that, when used alone, increased intracellular nkg2d amounts (fig. 3c).figure 3hmba affects nkg2d and dap10 expression. (a) cell-surface nkg2d expression on nk cells at various time points following hmba treatment. histograms show nk cells treated or not (nt) with 5 mm hmba for 1 h (solid line), 6 h (dashed line) and 18 h (filled grey histograms) in one representative experiment out of three. (b) kinetics of nkg2d internalization in nk cells treated or not with hmba for 18 h. mean ± sem values of nkg2d mfi were calculated over time with respect to initial expression (set to 100%) in 3 independent experiments. (c) intracellular nkg2d expression was measured in permeabilized nk cells following 18 h treatment with hmba and 12.5 ng/ml of il-15, either alone or in combination, as compared to nt cells. nkg2d mfi (mean ± sem) in 3 independent experiments is shown. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by two-tailed paired t test. (d,e) equal amounts of total cellular lysate of nk cells treated or not with hmba for 18 h were analyzed by western blotting with anti-nkg2d (d) or anti-dap10 (e) antibodies as well as with anti-gapdh mab to confirm equal protein loading. molecular mass standards (kda) are indicated. one representative of four independent experiments is shown. uncropped blots are presented in supplementary fig. s1. (f) relative nkg2d and dap10 mrna levels in nk cells treated with hmba compared with control nt cells was measured by real-time qpcr. shown are mean ± sem from three independent experiments performed in triplicate.full size imagefinally, nkg2d expression was analyzed at both protein and mrna levels. by western blotting analysis of total lysates of nk cells, we found that overall protein amounts of nkg2d and its dap10 adaptor were strongly reduced by hmba (median 75% and 60% reduction, respectively; fig. 3d,e show representative blots). of note, this effect of hmba was associated with a dramatic decrease of nkg2d and dap10 mrna levels (median 70% and 80% reduction, respectively; fig. 3f).overall, these data indicate that nkg2d downregulation by hmba does not result from accelerated receptor internalization or retention in intracellular compartments, but is rather due to impaired gene expression and, hence, neo-synthesis of nkg2d. furthermore, results indicate that hmba also suppresses the expression of dap10 that is required for stable nkg2d anchorage at the cell membrane50,51.hmba decreases nk cell cytotoxicitythe negative impact on nkg2d expression suggests that hmba may have deleterious effects on nk cell cytotoxic responses. to gain insights into this aspect, we set up a redirected killing assay to measure granule exocytosis (i.e. cd107a expression) by purified primary nk cells treated or not with hmba and/or il-15 upon interaction with p815 cells coated with anti-nkg2d mab or, as control, mouse igg1. in these settings, antibody-mediated triggering of nkg2d resulted in a ~2-fold increased frequency of cd107a+ cells among both untreated and il-15-stimulated nk cells, whereas this increase was completely abrogated by exposure to hmba (fig. 4a). interestingly, also il-15-induced increment of basal % of cd107a+ nk cells incubated with igg-coated p815 cells was significantly reduced if nk cells had been simultaneously exposed to hmba. moreover, to measure their killing activity, treated nk cells were challenged with k562 cells, a nkg2dl+ hla-i-devoid erythroleukemia cell line that serves as established target of nk cytotoxicity. to this end, nk cells derived from 6 donors were pretreated or not with hmba and/or il-15, then used as effectors at various effector-to-target (e:t) ratio in a facs-based assay that measures the percentage of specific lysis. figure 4b,c shows that exposure to hmba impairs the constitutive capacity of nk cells to kill k562 targets and, in addition, inhibits the enhancement of nk-cell cytotoxicity by il-15. in sum, results demonstrate a detrimental effect of hmba on nkg2d-mediated activation and, more in general, on il-15-induced cytotoxicity of nk cells.figure 4impact of hmba on nk-cell cytotoxicity. (a) a redirected antibody-dependent degranulation assay was performed with pbmcs cultivated for 18 h in medium alone (nt) or in the presence of 5 mm hmba and/or 12.5 ng/ml il-15. pbmcs were incubated for 6 h with p815 cells loaded with anti-nkg2d (α-nkg2d) mab or control igg in a re-directed degranulation assay. then, cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of cd107a on gated nk cells. the mean ± sem percentage of cd107a+ nk cells measured in 3 independent experiments is shown. *p < 0.05 by two-tailed paired t test. (b,c) nk cells cultivated for 18 h without stimuli (nt), with hmba and/or il-15 were tested for cytotoxicity against k562 cell targets at different e:t ratio. (b) the percent specific lysis of a representative experiment out of 6 is shown. (c) the nk cell-mediated lysis measured in 6 independent experiments was converted in lytic units (lu, median and interquartile range). each symbol represents 1 donor. *p < 0.05 by wilcoxon matched-pairs test.full size imagelysis of leukemia t cells by nk cells is inhibited by hmbaaltogether, results suggest that hmba can have opposite effects on the nkg2d/nkg2dl axis as the drug, on one hand, upmodulates nkg2dls on target cells and, on the other hand, reduces nkg2d expression and cytotoxicity in nk cells. then, we investigated the overall impact in nk cell-mediated killing of t-all cells when both effectors and targets are exposed to hmba. to this end, target cells (jurkat, cem, and molt-4) and effector nk cells were cultivated for 18 h in medium alone (referred as tnt and ent, respectively) or supplemented with hmba (thmba and ehmba, respectively) prior being used in lysis assays at various e:t ratio. in pilot experiments we observed that, when not stimulated by cytokines, purified primary nk cells displayed very low to null killing activity against t-all cells (data not shown), thus all nk cell cultures were supplemented with il-15. in agreements with previous reports52,53, lysis of untreated jurkat, cem, and molt-4 cells by nk cells was nkg2d-dependent, since it was significantly reduced by masking the receptor with specific mab (51 ± 10%, 36 ± 8%, and 32 ± 7%, respectively, mean ± sem lysis inhibition calculated at three e:t ratio in 3 independent experiments; a representative experiment is shown in fig. 5a). unexpectedly, we found that treatment of the three cell targets with hmba did not increase their susceptibility to killing by untreated effectors (fig. 5a shows a representative set of results). in addition, alongside with the negative effects in nk cells, prior hmba exposure of nk cells resulted in a strong inhibition of their capacity to kill untreated targets, that is, by comparing ehmba:tnt vs ent:tnt, lysis was inhibited by 70 ± 11%, 75 ± 4%, and 43 ± 6% for jurkat, cem, and molt-4 cells, respectively (fig. 5a,b). a similar inhibition was also observed when both effectors and targets have been treated with hmba (fig. 5a,b). therefore, micb and ulbp2 upmodulation by hmba on t-all cells (fig. 1b,c) does not enhance their susceptibility to nk-cell killing and, moreover, hmba impairs the overall cytotoxicity of il-15-stimulated nk cells against t-all targets, possibly affecting other activating pathways in addition to the one mediated by nkg2d.figure 5hmba inhibits nk cell-mediated killing of leukemia t cells. (a,b) nk cells either treated with hmba (ehmba) or not treated (ent) were used as effectors at various e:t ratio in a 4 h cytotoxicity assay against jurkat, cem and molt-4 target cells that have been as well exposed (thmba) or not to hmba (tnt). (a) the percent specific lysis of a representative experiment out of 3 is shown. results obtained with untreated nk cells (ent) pre-incubated with saturating amounts of anti-nkg2d blocking mab (α-nkg2d) and tested against tnt are also shown. (b) data are expressed as specific lysis inhibition at e:t ratio of 1:1 relative to ent:tnt lysis set at 100% (mean ± sem, n = 3).full size imagehmba synergizes with pro at upregulating ulbp2 on hiv-1-infected cd4+ t cells that exit from viral latencywe recently showed that in cd4+ t cells latently infected with hiv-1, the virus upmodulate nkg2dls, particularly ulbp2, when reactivated by signaling modulators such as phytohemagglutinin (pha) and pro, or by saha, a polar compound with hdaci activity that is structurally related to hmba14,22. as hmba stands among candidate lras to be employed in hiv-1 eradication strategies, we investigated whether hmba could modulate nkg2dls in the context of viral reactivation and, hence, favor nkg2d-mediated recognition of cells that exit viral latency. previously reported data indicate that, while the lra activity of hmba is evident in latently hiv-1-infected t cell lines38,42,54, hmba may not be effective at stimulating latent hiv-1 in primary cd4+ t cells derived from art patients if not occasionally39,42,48,55, unless used in combination with another lra such as pro42. therefore, we established latent hiv-1 infection in primary resting cd4+ t cells derived from healthy donors and cultivated these cells for 72 h in medium alone (not stimulated, ns) or supplemented with 5 mm hmba and/or 1 μm pro, or, as maximal stimulation, with 10 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (pha), then analyzed the expression of intracellular p24 (hiv-1 gag capsid antigen) and cell-surface ulbp2 levels (representative and summary data with 3 donors are shown in fig. 6a–d). we found that individual treatment with pro but not hmba induced the appearance of p24+ cells above the levels due to endogenous viral reactivation in ns cultures (35 ± 1% vs 12 ± 2%, p = 0.018, fixing p24+ cells in pha samples at 100%; fig. 6a,b), associated with an induction of ulbp2 on p24+ cells both as %ulbp2+ cells and ulbp2 mfi (fig. 6c,d). we also found that, if compared with pro alone, the simultaneous exposure to hmba and pro reactivated hiv-1 to a higher extent in 1 donor and, conversely, to a lower extent in 2 donors (35 ± 1% vs 26 ± 15% p24+ cells, mean ± sem, p = 0.572), nonetheless ulbp2 expression on p24+ cells was further upmodulated to significantly higher levels in all tested donors (fig. 6c,d). apparently, hmba has a poor latency reversal activity, at least in a primary cd4+ t cell-based model system that measures accumulation of a late viral protein. however, when used in association with pro, hmba can further enhance ulbp2 expression induced by pro-reactivated hiv-1.figure 6hmba synergizes with pro at upregulating ulbp2 on hiv-1-infected t cells that exit from viral latency. (a–d) to establish viral latency, freshly isolated cd4+ t cells were cultivated in the presence of ccl19 for 1–3 days, infected or not with hiv-1, and further cultured for 3 days, as described in details in materials and methods. then, cells were treated with 5 mm hmba or 1 μm pro, alone or in combination, stimulated with 10 μg/ml pha or not stimulated (ns), further cultivated for 3 days and finally analyzed by 2-color flow cytometry for the expression of intracellular p24 and cell-surface ulbp2. (a) representative dot plots show the frequency of reactivated p24+ cells gated by setting non-infected pha-stimulated control cells at 0%.

(a) the expression of nkg2d on nk cells not treated or exposed to hmba, pro, or hmba + pro for 18 h was measured as % of positive cells and nkg2d mfi (mean ± sem, n = 3). (b–d) a co-culture assay of latently infected cd4+ t cells at day 2 post-stimulation with 1 μm pro alone or in combination with 5 mm hmba and autologous nk cells at a 1:1 e:t ratio was performed overnight (18 h) in the presence of the same drug(s). then, cells were analyzed to measure the frequency of p24+ cells among gated cd3+ targets and calculate % reduction of 24+ targets by nk cells. (b) the cd3+ cell gate was set on cultures of targets alone, so that effectors cells were excluded, as shown in control cultures of effectors alone as well as in co-cultures of targets and effectors in a representative experiment. (c) a representative set of results for nt, pro-, and hmba + pro-exposed cultures is shown. (d) the nk cell mediated clearance of p24+ cells was measured in 3 independent experiments and expressed as % 24+ killing (mean ± sem) as described in materials and methods. each symbol represents 1

myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia, but later dismissed on the basis of limited efficacy36,37. recent data disclosing hmba capacity to reactivate latent hiv-1 reservoirs has opened the possibility that the drug re-enters into the clinics in the context of hiv-1 eradication strategies38,39,42,48,55. herein, we demonstrated that hmba has opposite dual effects on the nkg2d/nkg2dls axis that crucially controls nk cell mediated elimination of tumors and virus-infected cells. indeed, we provided the first evidence that hmba upmodulates nkg2dls while, on the other hand, impairs nkg2d-mediated responses of nk cells, which has important implications for hmba therapeutic application.we showed that, in treated jurkat, cem, and molt-4 cells, hmba specifically increased the cell-surface expression of micb and ulbp2 without affecting mica or ulbp1. this effect is analogous to that of other anti-cancer drugs, including the natural occurring polyphenol resveratrol, various hdaci (e.g. saha, romidepsin, trichostatin a, valproate), and proteasome inhibitors (e.g. bortezomib), that were shown to upregulate mica/b (detected with an antibody recognizing both mica and micb molecules) and ulbp2 in jurkat or molt-4 cells56,57,58,59,60. hmba may possibly upregulate micb and ulbp2 at the transcriptional level by its reported capacity to activate e2f and p5333,35, which positively regulate expression of nkg2dl genes9. in addition, it is feasible that p-tefb activation by hmba can enhance micb and ulbp2 mrna elongation, a mechanism through which cells bypass transcriptional pausing of several genes belonging to the innate immune system to allow rapid and robust immune responses61. unexpectedly, we found that micb and ulbp2 upregulation by hmba in t-all cells was not associated with increased susceptibility to nk-cell mediated killing (fig. 5a). these results are in contrast with the fact that nk cells kill leukemic t cells in a nkg2d-dependent fashion (this study and ref.52), and with a higher efficiency when mica/b and/or ulbp2 are induced by hdaci or other drugs56,57,58,59. we hypothesize that enhanced susceptibility of t-all cells to nk-cell killing is strictly correlated with the surface density of a nkg2dl distinct from those induced by hmba such as mica. indeed, by using a specific anti-mica antibody, treatment of jurkat or a jurkat-derived cell line (j-latgfp) with saha or other hdaci resulted in a 4-fold increase of mica expression along with micb and ulbp2 upmodulation (ref.14 and our unpublished data). apparently, optimal exposure of t-all cells to nkg2d-mediated responses of nk cells may require induction of mica and/or other nkg2dl that cannot be achieved with hmba, but rather with hdacis.another unexpected result of the present study consists in the negative impact of hmba on nk cell phenotype and function. we found that, in nk cells, hmba reduced nkg2d mrna levels and overall protein amounts, resulting in cell-surface nkg2d downmodulation and decreased degranulation activity upon nkg2d triggering in a redirected killing assay. moreover, the capacity of hmba-treated nk cells to kill tumor targets that largely depend on nkg2d/nkg2dl interactions, such as t-all or k562 cells, was drastically reduced. hmba also reduced the nkg2d adaptor dap10 at both mrna and protein level, a phenomenon that can account not only for impaired signaling of cell-surface nkg2d molecules, but also for receptor downregulation. accumulating evidence, indeed, shows that association with dap10 is required for nkg2d protection from degradation and stable expression at the cell membrane50,51. further studies are required to determine the precise mechanism by which hmba reduces nkg2d and dap10 gene transcription. importantly, by modulating dap10 amounts, cytokines regulate nkg2d expression levels and, more in general, the effector function of nk cells, with a positive effect on dap10 protein synthesis exerted by cytokines belonging to the common γ chain (γc) family, namely il-2, il-7, and il-15, and an opposite effect driven by tgf-β1 that reduces dap10 gene transcription51. using a mouse model targeting dap10 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in nk cells, it has been shown that dap10 transduces signals downstream of il-15 receptor (il-15r) and is required for il-15 stimulation of nk cell survival, proliferation, and nkg2d-mediated cytotoxicity50. of note, we found that hmba-exposed nk cells with reduced dap10 levels are unresponsive to il-15 in terms of upmodulation of nkg2d and nkp44 receptor expression, nkg2d-mediated activation, and killing of transformed or infected cells. our data strongly support the essential role of dap10 in nk cells for the response to il-15 stimulation and in coupling the nkg2d and il-15r signaling pathways. most importantly, the detrimental effects of hmba observed in vitro in nk cells, even when activated by il-15, suggest that hmba administration may compromise nk cell-mediated elimination of tumor cells in vivo, a phenomenon that might have contributed to poor clinical outcome reported in hmba-treated patients with myelo-dysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia36,37.results of the present study also show that the deleterious effects of hmba on nk-cell phenotype and function may have negative implications for its employment in hiv-1 eradication strategies. the potential of hmba in the reversal of hiv-1 latency has been recently reported, especially when combined with a second lra belonging to a distinct functional category such as pro42,43. by using a primary cd4+ t-cell based model of hiv-1 latency, we found that hmba was devoid of the capacity to reactivate the virus when used alone or in combination with pro, which is in contrast with previous reports42,43. conflicting results are possibly due to differences in model systems and method of quantification, consisting in intracellular p24+ accumulation in primary t cells (this study) as opposed to hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr)-driven transcription in t-cell lines43, or genomic viral rna levels in culture supernatant of pbmcs from art-treated patients42. aligned with our data, a study based on latently infected primary t cells showed that treatment with pro but not hmba exposed these cells to recognition by hiv-1-specific ctls55. though devoid of lra activity, we found that hmba synergized with pro at upregulating ulbp2 on those p24+ t cells harboring pro-reactivated virus. these results are in agreement with the reported capacity of hmba to prolong and potentiate nf-κb activation initiated by pro via the suppression of the a20 deubiquitinase and, as a consequence, sustained degradation of the nf-κb inhibitor iκbα43. on the other hand, hmba decreased nkg2d expression on nk cells in a dominant manner over pro-mediated stimulation and damped nk cell-mediated clearance of p24+ t cell targets despite their higher ulbp2 expression in hmba + pro cultures. these results suggest that hmba might be too weak to induce effective hiv-1 latency reversal, even when combined with a distinct lra. in addition, the detrimental effects on the anti-viral responses of nk cells discourage the inclusion of hmba in hiv-1 ‘shock-and-kill’ approaches, especially since results from initial clinical trials in art patients indicate that nk cells have an important role, possibly superior to that of ctls, in the context of viral eradication strategies62,63,64,65. furthermore, hmba may reduce nkg2d expression also on cd8+ t cells (our unpublished observations), which can compromise the cytotoxic activity of these cells upon nkg2d costimulation66, yet further studies are required to investigate this phenomenon.altogether, within the limitations of an in vitro study, results presented herein not only provide one possible explanation for the failure of hmba in previous clinical trials, but also raise concerns for future therapeutic application of this drug. indeed, by impairing expression of nkg2d in nk cells, hmba hampers a crucial pathway in nk cell-mediated elimination of tumor and infected cells. moreover, likely by impairing dap10 expression, hmba inhibits the capacity of nk cells to respond to il-15, which is essential for nk cell development and function. of note, il-15 and, above all, il-15 analogs with superior stability and efficacy are currently under investigation as immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors as well as for hiv-1 eradication67. accumulating evidence shows that il-15 agents have some efficacy as monotherapy, but they have a great potential when used in combination with chemotherapy agents, resulting in enhanced nk cell activity against tumor recurrence and metastasis in animal models68.the unexpected inhibition exerted by hmba on nk cell function overriding il-15 stimulation disclosed in the present study emphasizes that novel hybrid polar agents and, more in general, anticancer drugs being taken forwards in clinical trials either alone or in combination, should be systematically tested for their impact on the effector function of nk cells and, conceivably, other cytotoxic cells.materials and methodcell lines and reagentsprimary nk and cd4+ t cells, fcγr+ p815, k562, jurkat e6-1, ccrf-cem (cem), and molt-4 cells were maintained in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10%

ulbp2/5/6 (mab1298) from r&d systems. as a secondary antibody, alexa647- or alexa488-coniugated goat anti-mouse igg (gam) (invitrogen) was used.for western blotting we employed antibodies against nkg2d (clone 3.1.1.1; kind gift of carsten watzl, ifado, dortmund, germany), dap10 (clone h-2, sc-133173; santa cruz biotechnology), and gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (mab374;

cytotoxicity, and redirected nk-cell lysis.when indicated, cells were treated with 5 μm hmba, 1 μm pro, 10 μg/ml pha (all from sigma-aldrich), 12.5 ng/ml il-15 (peprotech), and 29 nm ccl19 (r&d systems).flow cytometryto assess viability, cells were stained with live/dead fixable near-ir dead cell stain kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (life technologies). to stain cd107a, cell cultures were supplemented with cd107a/fitc mab (or control igg1/fitc) for 6 h, with the addition of monensin (golgi stop, diluted 1:1500; bd pharmingen) and 10 μg/ml brefeldin a (sigma-aldrich) after the first hour. the cell-surface and intracellular staining procedures were performed as described previously14. immunolabeled cells resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde (pfa) were acquired on a facscanto ii (bd biosciences) or cytoflex (beckman coulter). positive cell gating was set using fluorescence minus one control (fmo). mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) was subtracted of the value obtained with isotype control antibody. data analyses were performed using flowjo software (treestar).internalization assayto measure the rate of nkg2d internalization, nk cells were collected after 18 h of culture with or without 5 mm hmba, washed with cold pbs, reacted with anti-nkg2d mab (0.05 μg/μl in pbs) for 30 min on ice, washed twice, and placed at 37 °c and 5% co2. the endocytosis reaction was stopped after 5, 15, and 30 min of incubation by transferring an aliquot of cells on ice and adding nan3 at a final 0.5% concentration. next, the cells were stained with secondary antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry.western blottingnk cells were lysed as described previously69, then 20 μg of total cell lysate was separated on 10% sds-page and immunoblotted with primary then secondary antibodies. the protein-specific signals were detected with pierce ecl substrate (thermo scientific) and quantified by densitometry.real-time qpcrbriefly, total rna was extracted from nk cells treated or not with hmba for 18 h using trizol (life technologies). aliquots (1 μg) of total rna were used to generate cdna using random hexamers and the resulting cdna (25 ng) was amplified in triplicate using the sensifast sybr green pcr master mix (all from bioline). for each target (nkg2d, dap10, and the 18 s rrna calibrator gene), forward (f) and reverse (r) primers were designed across

18 h in medium alone (nt) or supplemented with 5 mm hmba and/or 12,5 ng/ml il-15 were seeded in plates in a 96-well plate (0.2 × 106/well). fcγr+ p815 cells (targets) were loaded with anti-nkg2d mab (5 μg/106 cells) or equivalent amounts of igg1 for 15 min at room temperature, then washed and plated with effectors at 1:2.5 e:t ratio (0.5 × 106/well) in complete medium supplemented with anti-cd107a/fitc or igg1/fitc and incubated at 37 °c for 6 h. after the first hour, monensin (golgi stop, diluted 1:1500) and 10 μg/ml brefeldin a were added to cultures. finally cells were immunolabeled and analyzed by flow cytometry to measure the frequency of cd107a+ cells within gated nk cell population (cd3+cd56+cd16+/−).nk-cell cytotoxicity assaysflow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays were performed as described previously14, using k562 cells as targets and purified primary nk cells treated for 18 h with 5 μm hmba and 12.5 ng/ml il-15, either alone or in combination, or not treated (nt), as effectors. in addition, jurkat, cem, or molt-4 cells that have been cultivated for 18 h with or without hmba were used as targets of nk cells pre-treated for 18 h with il-15 alone or together with hmba. briefly, 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (cfse; sigma-aldrich)-labeled nk cells were co-cultivated with target cells at different effector-to-target cell (e:t) ratios for 4 h. when indicated, nk cells were treated with anti-nkg2d blocking antibody (1 μg/106 cells) or control igg1 for 15 minutes prior to incubation with target cells. next, cells were labeled with 7-aminoactinomycin d (7-aad; sigma-aldrich), fixed and acquired by facs. the percentage of specific lysis of target cells (gated as cfse−) was calculated as follows: 100 × (%7-aad+ target cells in sample − basal %7-aad+ target cells)/(100 − basal %7-aad+ target cells). for k562 targets, specific lysis derived from three e:t ratios was conversed to lytic units (lu), defined as the number of effector cells required to lyse 20% of 2 × 105 target cells70, and results were expressed as the number of lu contained in 107 nk cells.establishment and reactivation of latently infected cd4+ t cellsprimary cd4+ t cells cultures infected with hiv-1 were established and then reactivated as previously described with minor modifications71. briefly, purified cd4+ t cells were cultivated with 29 nm ccl19 (r&d systems) for 1–3 days. after this period, the quiescent state of the cells was verified by excluding the presence of cd69+, cd25+, and hla-dr+ cells by facs analysis. then, cells were infected by spinoculation with 300 ng p24/106 cells of nl4-3 hiv-1 (nih aids reagent program) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (vsv-g), washed, and placed back in culture in complete medium without chemokine or cytokines. to activate the virus, latently infected cd4+ t cells were exposed to 5 μm hmba and 1 μμ pro, either alone or in combination, to 10 μg/ml pha, or not stimulated (ns) at day 3 post-infection. finally, at 72 h post-stimulation, cells were harvested and analyzed by facs for intracellular p24 accumulation and cell-surface nkg2dls expression.nk cell-mediated killing of reactivated hiv-1-infected cellsprimary hiv-1-infected cd4+ t cells (targets) reactivated with 1 μμ pro alone or together with 5 mm hmba or not treated (nt), were collected 54 h post-stimulation and further cultivated for 18 h in the same treatment conditions (nt, pro, pro + hmba) either alone or together with nk cells (effectors) purified from a cryopreserved aliquot of pbmcs of the same donor at an e:t ratio of 1:1. cells were then fixed/permeabilized and stained for p24 and cd3. finally, 7,000 target cells (gated as cd3+) were acquired by facs. the percent nk cell-mediated killing of p24+ cells was calculated with the following formula: 100 × (%p24+ cells in targets − %p24+ cells in targets with effectors)/(%p24+ cells in targets).statistical analysisall experiments have been performed independently at least three times. graphpad prism 6.0 software was used to perform all statistical analyses. a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically

Variations in plantar pressure and balance in HIV-infected children in antiretroviral therapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41028-0,Research,13 March 2019,yes,"balance disorders have been poorly investigated and somewhat neglected in people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, especially in children, whose have intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that may compromise the balance. to evaluate the foot plantar pressures and the balance in children with acquired immunodeficiency. we recruited 53 children aged between 6 and 15 years: 33 healthy children, and 20 children with positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus. a physical examination included anthropometric, reflexes, tactile sensitivity of the foot and orthopedic evaluation. we also collected data of them using pediatric equilibrium scale, baropodometry, and stabilometry. we considered significance level of 0.05 for statistics. both groups were aged-, sex-matched and similar body mass index and scores of the pediatric equilibrium scale. three infected children had altered tactile sensitivity, and none had orthopedic or reflex alteration. infected children had higher mean plantar pressure in the hindfoot than of the control group (p = 0.02). there was higher maximum plantar pressure in the hindfoot of the infected children than of the controls (p = 0.04). controls had lower maximum plantar pressure in the forefoot than the infected children (p = 0.04). infected children had larger displacement of the center of pressure (p = 0.006), larger mean velocity of displacement (p = 0.006), and longer duration between successive peaks of displacement than the controls (p = 0.02). children living with the human immunodeficiency virus discharges great plantar pressures in the hindfoot and to present balance disturbances in the absence of neurological symptomatology.
introduction despite the advances in the prophylaxis and treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, it still impacts a large number of individuals1. about 37 million people in the world is infected with hiv, along with 1.8 million children under 15 years2,3,4. the transmission of hiv from the hiv-infected mother to her child during pregnancy is concerning because the virus infection will occur in the first ages of the neuropsychomotor development5.previous investigations have reported deficits in cognitive, sensory, and motor functions in hiv-infected individuals6,7,8. these deficits compromise psychomotor abilities, visuomotor integration, visuospatial perception, and language7. clinical evidence of balance and gait disturbances were frequently detected in hiv-infected adults9,10,11,12. these investigations reported distal neuropathy that would impair balance and vibrotactile sensation. one possible consequence of the deficits in the postural control is the load distribution on the plantar surface of the foot9. the topographical recording of pressures on the plantar surface of the foot could indicate imbalance and overload on the foot’s structure13,14. balance disorders have been poorly investigated and somewhat neglected in hiv-infected people.the exposure to antiretroviral therapy (art), tropism of the hiv to the nervous system, and the children nervous system development can turn this hiv-infected population more susceptible to deficits in postural control and its functional repercussions. the present investigation compared a quantitative evaluation of balance and plantar foot pressure of hiv-infected and non-infected children.resultsgeneral featuresno patients had deformities and spasms in the limbs, as well as they also have normal reflexes. the areas of the feet of the subjects were identified as altered sensitivity from the perception with the violet filament, considering 9 areas in the plantar surface. hiv+ subjects 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 and 19 were considered with altered sensitivity. when analyzing the proprioceptive sensitivity through the diapason, no alteration was found for this type of sensitivity in both groups.table 1 shows the general information of the sample from each group. both groups were age- and sex-matched, and they had similar physical features (weight, height, and body mass index). both groups also had non-significant differences for the pediatric balance scale.table 1 comparison of the general features of control group and hiv infected group (hiv+).full size

tableplantar foot surface pressuretables 3 and 4 compare the results of the medium and maximum plantar pressure between both groups, respectively. both groups had an expected load distribution on the feet featuring a higher load on the hindfoot compared to the load on the midfoot and forefoot. the comparison of the mean plantar pressure between both groups for the open-eyed condition had no significant difference in any area of the foot. in the hindfoot, both areas (mh and lh) were in the border of statistical significance (p = 0.05). for the ce condition, the comparison of the mean plantar pressure also had no significant intergroup difference except in the area lh of the hindfoot. the participants of the hiv+ had higher plantar pressure in the hindfoot than the controls (p < 0.05, statistical power = 60%).table 3 comparison of the mean plantar pressure, in kpa, (10−3 × mean ± standard deviation) between control group and hiv+.full size tabletable 4 comparison of the maximum plantar pressure, in kpa, (10−3 × mean ± standard deviation) between control group and hiv+.full size tableboth groups also had the same profile of the maximum plantar pressure distribution on the foot. the higher loads were found in the hindfoot compared to the other regions of the foot. for the intergroup comparison of the plantar pressures in the eo condition, we observed that again, the hiv+ had a significantly higher load than the control group in the lh area of the hindfoot (p < 0.05, statistical power = 50%). in the other areas of the foot, no significant difference was found. in the ce condition, we observed that there were significant differences in the areas, t1 and t2-5, in which the hiv+ had lower load than the controls (p < 0.05, statistical power = 60–80%). no other areas had significant differences in the intergroup comparison of the maximum plantar pressure.stabilometrythe balance evaluation results are shown in table 5. we observed that hiv+ had larger cop displacement and higher speed than the controls for both eo and ce conditions (p < 0.05, statistical power = 80–85%). we also observed that hiv+ had less mt values than the controls in the opened-eyed condition (p < 0.05, statistical power = 60%). no other comparison had significant intergroup difference.table 5 comparisons of the posturographic results between the control group and hiv+.full size tablediscussion this study aimed to verify the impact of hiv infection and the use of antiretroviral therapy on the pressure plantar and static balance of children and adolescents living with aids. the study identified a tendency of weight load in the region on the hindfoot in hiv+ participants and change in the postural control indicated by the variables cop distance, mean velocity, and mt.the foot is the only ground attachment during bipedal locomotion. it has an important function in supporting body load, impact dampening, and the maintenance of postural stability, and it adapts to the structural and functional changes that occur throughout life15,16,17,18. a developing child can stand independently at 12 months of age, and after this motor acquisition, there is a specific and continuous refinement of postural control throughout childhood19.previously, other investigations have shown posturographic changes in asymptomatic and symptomatic adult patients infected with hiv (see a review in berner et al.)20. the studies have investigated the balance disturbances using different methods such as measurements of centre of pressure oscilation, recordings of postural reflex latency, and timed clinical test. trendwalker et al.12 observed that hiv-infected patients had postural instability, especially when they were in unstable foot support under a force platform. arendt et al.10 used a force plate to study 36 hiv-infected subjects, but asymptomatic for neurological dysfunctions, and 10 hiv-infected subjects in the early stage of encephalopathy. they observed that either the patients with encephalopathy either 25% of asymptomatic individuals had disturbance in the postural control. delepiane et al.11 recorded static and dynamic posturagraphic using force platform also demonstrated individuals with advanced hiv/aids, as well as hiv-infected patients with asymptomatic neurology, exhibited altered postural control when compared to a control group. bauer et al.9 carried out a study on 28 hiv-infected subjects without art, 25 hiv-infected subjects using nucleoside analog inhibitors, 37 hiv-infected subjects using art, and 78 subjects without positive hiv serology. they identified a decrease in postural control and abnormalities in the vibrotactile threshold in the three hiv-infected groups during the test on the platform with eyes closed9. the vibrotactile threshold was influenced by the type of art, while the balance was not. however, these alterations, even when present, were considered to be moderate in relation to the control group. our results showed that similar results observed in a hiv-infected adult sample were also found in a hiv-infected children sample.neurological manifestations in individuals with hiv/aids are well documented in the literature6,7,8,21. for christo8, the most important determinant of vulnerability to structural damage to the nervous system is the degree of immunosuppression. neurological manifestations compromise about 40% to 70% of hiv carriers during the course of the infection, and in post-autopsy studies, these values approach 90% of the cases. blanchette et al.7 reported important abnormalities in hiv-infected children (impairment in the process of myelination and the presence of subcortical lesions) were found in imaging tests (computed tomography) and were associated with delayed motor and cognitive development. the involvement of the nervous system during the course of hiv infection is notorious. however, the frequency and timing of clinical manifestations, as well as the interactions with other risk factors for the development of developmental delays (and, consequently, deficiencies), are still not well characterized6,7,8,22. our hiv-infected sample had no deformities and normal reflexes. few of them had some tactile sensitivity loss, but in general, the hiv-infected children were neurologically asymptomatic, and they had normal balance when evaluated by pbs. our results indicated that the stabilometry and baropodometry could be used to detect subclinical neurological losses in hiv-infected children and enable us to evaluate the neurological status of hiv-infected children.the children we studied presented at least two conditions of vulnerability of nervous system involvement, either by the natural course of the disease as either by prolonged exposure to art. in this study, postural control in hiv+ children had altered results for the variables cop distance, mean velocity, and mt parameters. these three findings are indicators of the posture instabilibity of the patients. the increase of the cop distance of the hiv+ indicated greater oscilations than the controls. the time between successive peaks (mt) was also longer for the hiv+ with faster mean velocity than the controls.central postural control depends on the entrance of three peripheral modalities (vision, vestibular apparatus, and proprioception)23,24. the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems must be integrated to recognize and interpret complex sensory environments and act in conjunction with the motor and cognitive systems to provide inputs to maintain body stability25. in this study, the visual assessment was suppressed in the ec condition, but the surface of contact of the feet and the scenario were not modified—that is, there were no disturbances generating instability for the proprioceptive and vestibular systems, respectively. the absence of alterations in the romberg index for the different parameters allowed to exclude the visual impairment from the balance loss26, that probably reflect loss in proprioceptive or vestibular functions, which need to be further investigated.the baropodometric results we obtained indicated a tendency of the hiv-children to displace the body load in the hindfoot more than the controls. we found that infected children had higher load in the lh area of the hindfoot, and lower load in the t1, and t2-5 areas than controls. we found no differences in the bmi or even in the body structure. initial stages of gait, there is greater pressure on the hallux, with progressive distribution to almost all the regions of the foot with the increase of the age, followed by a decrease of the pressures on the midfoot, consequently to the appearance of the arches plantar and with progression growing and continuous to the back, around 8 years of age until adulthood15,16.studies in populations with infectious diseases have been anticipating subclinical balance abnormalities in infected but still asymptomatic patients. vasconcelos et al.13 compared the distribution of body weight in different areas of the feet in patients with human t-cell lymphoma virus type 1 (htlv-1) associated with myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (ham/tsp) and inferred that asymptomatic patients with htlv-1 presented higher plantar pressures in the forefoot region as well as those with neurological manifestations and with ham/tsp with a gait characterized by greater pressure distribution in the forefoot region. these patients presented spasticity of the lower limbs with consequent equinism of the feet, a fact that justifies the greater plantar pressure in the forefoot in symptomatic individuals and, thus, signals possible early involvement of the nervous system in asymptomatic individuals. in this way, they would be better investigated in populations with infectious and chronic diseases in which the etiological agent has a predilection to undermine the nervous system and cause subclinical signs of balance abnormalities since the viral latency stage can mimic possible damage to the nervous system and abnormalities in postural control.there is an imminent risk of aggression to the nervous and muscular systems, which need to be monitored, so with this study we intend to signal subclinical findings that are poorly investigated and neglected in follow-up services for people living with hiv/aids. our children and adolescents are in a situation of clinical and social vulnerability; the clinical conditions have already been exposed above and, socially, because they live in a unique region in relation to their geography, such as the amazon region, with difficult access to services and continuity to the treatment, as well as having low educational level and living in poverty. early detection of postural control abnormalities may lead to the development of assessment protocols, establishment of guidelines in health services, training of professionals for monitoring and treatment by rehabilitation staff, including the physical therapist, to minimize the damages caused by the aggressive effects of hiv and its drug therapies.in conclusion , according to the progression of age, the plantar pressures distribute to the regions of the forefoot and back, mainly due to the appearance of the plantar arches. hiv+ children and adolescents presented greater weight load in the hindfoot region, specifically in the lh area in closed eyes, perhaps signaling involvement of sensory pathways. these presented subclinical postural instability, since abnormalities in postural control were detected for the variables cop distance, mean velocity and mean time between successive peaks of cop.methodssubjectsfifty-three children aged under 15 years were divided into two groups: a control group (cg) composed of 33 children (21 males, 12 females, 9.5 ± 2.4 years-old) with negative hiv serology, and aids group (hiv+) composed of 20 children (12 males, 8 females, 9.6 ± 2.6 years-old) infected vertically by the hiv. hiv-infected individuals had received art for at least 1 year and were recruited from a mother and child reference unit of the belém city, brazil, reference in treatment and follow-up of hiv-infected children.we excluded hiv-infected children with active pulmonary opportunistic diseases, congenital heart disease, presence of behavioral alterations, presence of incapacitating physical limitations, gait alterations, vestibular alterations, transmetatarsal amputation, visual deficits, hearing impairment, chronic diabetes, and with hyperhidrosis.the study was approved by the ethics committee of the federal university of pará (report #1438). the parent and/or legal guardian of all children were informed about the procedures and have the written consent form agreeing with their participation. in addition, subjects aged 12 or over also signed an informed consent for participation in the survey. all experiments were performed in accordance with the tenets of helsinki declaration.laboratorial characteristicsit was performed only with the hiv+ for ethical reasons. we obtained, from its more recent clinical recordings, the information of viral load, tcd4 and tcd8 lymphocyte counts, the time of art initiation, and the drug therapy in use.body mass index (bmi)anthropometric evaluation was done using a height and weight measuring instrument (filizola, são paulo, brazil) at the moment of the interview. body mass index (bmi) was calculated using equation 1.$${\rm{bmi}}=\frac{{\rm{w}}}{{{\rm{h}}}^{2}}$$

                        where bmi is the body mass index, w is the weight in kg, and h is the height in cm.physical assessmentthe deformity and muscle spasm evaluation was made by the tests of thomas and galeazzi27. the evaluation of the patellar and calcaneal reflexes was performed using a reflex hammer, and these were classified as absent, decreased, normal, or increased. the tactile sensitivity of the plantar surface of the foot was investigated by using the semmes-weinstein monofilaments, five monofilaments that bent when a force of 0.2, 2, 4, 10, and 300 g was used. the test was first performed with the blue monofilament (0.2 g) that was touched on 9 different areas of the feet (6 forefoot areas, 2 midfoot areas, and 1 hindfoot area), and then the subjects were asked to indicate when and where the touch occurred. each monofilament was applied three times in the same area. the sensitivity threshold was defined as the lighter monofilament identified by the subject. when the threshold was greater than 2 g, the tactile sensitivity of the skin in this area was considered altered.pediatric balance scalepediatric balance scale (pbs) was developed from the modification of the berg balance scale to obtain a more adequate scale for the children population128,29,30. pbs is composed of 14 tasks with five items each and scores varying from 0 to 4 for each task: 0 means unable to perform the task and 4 means performs task in an independent way. the total score varies from 0–56 points, with scores between 41 and 56 points being considered low risk of falling, medium risk of falls between 21 and 40 points, and high risk of falls from 0 to 20 points.stabilometric and plantar foot surface pressure measurementssimultaneous stabilometric and plantar foot pressure measurements were performed using a capacitive pressure platform (eps/r-1 model, loran engineering, castel maggiore, bologna, italy) with 2224 sensors distributed in 48 cm2 and connected to a computer with the biomech software, with a sample rate of 50 hz.the subjects remained with both feet on the platform, one foot apart, with the arm laterally to the body, and 1 m away from a wall with a cross for eye fixation. the tests were performed barefoot with eyes open (eo) and eyes closed (ec). we used a black eye patch to close the eye. the volunteers were asked to maintain a stationary and comfortable posture on the platform and no movement during the 60 seconds of the test. three trials for both eo and ec conditions were performed, and we analyzed the average of the trials.for the measurements of plantar pressures, bilaterally, the forefoot, midfoot and hindfoot regions, as well as the specific areas of contact distribution of the feet with the ground were considered: t1 (hallux); t2-5 (other toes); m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5 (heads of each of the metatarsals); mf (midfoot); and mh and lh (medial and lateral hindfoot region). mean maximum and medium pressure in kpa was analyzed.for the balance measurements, the following global parameters were evaluated: center of pressure (cop), cop velocity, antero-posterior deviation (x-axis), mid-lateral deviation (y-axis), and area of an ellipse that covers 90% of the total area covered in the mid-lateral and antero-posterior deviations31,32,33. we also estimated structural posturographic parameters from the sway density curve that were mean peak values (mp) on the sway density curve, mean time interval (mt), in seconds, between successive peaks, and mean distance (ms) representing the mean distance between successive peaks in mm33,34.for each posturographic parameter, we measured the romberg quotient, which is the ratio during the evaluation with oe and ce26.statistical analysisstatistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 5.0 software. the d’agostino-pearson test was used to evaluate the normality of the data. the variables of the present study had a non-normal distribution, requiring the use of non-parametric tests for the statistical analysis. the intergroup comparison was performed using mann-whitney test. the statistical power was calculated using the graphpad statmate tool. all the results were considered statistically significant at the significance level of 5%.

Highly Mutable Linker Regions Regulate HIV-1 Rev Function and Stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41582-7,Research,26 March 2019,yes,"hiv-1 rev is an essential viral regulatory protein that facilitates the nuclear export of intron-containing viral mrnas. it is organized into structured, functionally well-characterized motifs joined by less understood linker regions. our recent competitive deep mutational scanning study confirmed many known constraints in rev’s established motifs, but also identified positions of mutational plasticity, most notably in surrounding linker regions. here, we probe the mutational limits of these linkers by testing the activities of multiple truncation and mass substitution mutations. we find that these regions possess previously unknown structural, functional or regulatory roles, not apparent from systematic point mutational approaches. specifically, the n- and c-termini of rev contribute to protein stability; mutations in a turn that connects the two main helices of rev have different effects in different contexts; and a linker region which connects the second helix of rev to its nuclear export sequence has structural requirements for function. thus, rev function extends beyond its characterized motifs, and is tuned by determinants within seemingly plastic portions of its sequence. additionally, rev’s ability to tolerate many of these massive truncations and substitutions illustrates the overall mutational and functional robustness inherent in this viral protein.
introduction proteins balance optimal functionality with mutational tolerance in order to adapt to changes in selection pressures1. proteins with high tolerance for mutation are considered genetically “robust” or “plastic”, while proteins with a low mutability are considered genetically “fragile” or “brittle”2. the existence of a protein sequence as fragile or robust is a result of evolutionary pressures acting on the protein, such as mutation rate and biological function. fragility and robustness are generally expected to couple with protein structure and disorder: disordered regions are expected to be robust while structured regions are comparatively brittle3,4.viral proteins maintain their function amidst many forces such as high viral polymerase error rates, immune pressures, and even competing selective pressures from overlapping reading frames and rna structures. hiv-1 rev is one such essential viral protein which facilitates the nuclear export of intron-containing viral rnas that encode essential viral structural and enzymatic proteins and provide full length genomes for encapsidation5,6,7. rev experiences a high mutation rate in hiv (~10−3 mutations per base per cell8) and is also overlapped with two other essential viral proteins, tat and env (fig. 1a). overlap between viral genes is common9, but most hiv-1 genes have at least one region with no overlap in which they can encode critical functional domains in an unconstrained way (as we recently observed with hiv-1 tat10). in contrast, rev shares coding information with other viral genes throughout its length (the only hiv-1 gene encoded in such a manner) meaning that its evolution is coupled to these overlapping genes.figure 1structure and organization of hiv-1 rev. (a) domain organization of rev protein (nl4-3/hxb2 numbering) with interaction surfaces in shades of red (od: oligomerization domain; arm: arginine-rich motif; nes: nuclear export sequence) and linker regions in grey (n-term: n-terminus, turn, onl: od-nes linker). in the viral genome, the rev coding sequence consists of two exons (fig. 1a; “splice site” denotes exon-exon junction as it would occur in the mrna) both of which are contained entirely within (alternative reading frame) exons of two other hiv genes, tat and env. putative structured domains of tat (arm: arginine rich motif) and env (llp: lentivirus lytic peptide) are shown along with their overlap with rev domains. (b) structural model of rev built using rev crystal structures (residues 8–62 from pdbid: 3lph; residues 76–83 from pdbid: 3nbz; all other regions were built in pymol for visualization purposes). also shown is the experimental fitness of every residue in the rev linker regions (from10) (c). distribution of median experimental fitness values of each residue for different regions of rev classified by domain organization (data from10). specifically, there are 116 total data points each representing a single residue of rev, each binned into the appropriate domain; the representative value for each residue is the median fitness of all 21 side chains (and the stop codon) at that position).full size imagebecause of the overlap, the true functional importance of each rev residue is difficult to assess from traditional sequence conservation analyses and instead requires careful mutational dissection in non-overlapped contexts. to address this, we recently performed competitive deep mutational scanning (cdms) in non-overlapped viral replication assays10. these experiments allowed us to examine for the first time, the amino acid preferences/fitness in rev at each position, when unconstrained by overlapping genes.results from these experiments showed that, in general, the known structured/functional regions of rev experience selective pressure for specific side chains while the linker regions between/flanking these structured domains appear to be relatively “plastic”, freely mutating between many different side chains with a variety of chemical properties (fig. 1b,c). however, the true extent of this plasticity is unclear, as the approach only examined single point mutations within a reference viral strain background.in this study, we expand our analyses of the point mutational datasets to evaluate the limits of the structural and mutational plasticity of rev’s structured domains and unstructured linker regions by designing deletion and mass substitution mutations and testing them for function in reporter assays and viral replication assays. our results indicate that most of the linker regions possess previously unappreciated structural, functional or regulatory roles, not apparent from systematic point mutational approaches, while the structured regions tolerate more variation than expected. the n- and c-termini control rev stability; mutations in a turn that connects the two main helices of rev have different effects in nuclear export assays and viral replication assays, suggesting an alternate functional role besides nuclear export for this region; and a linker region connecting the second helix of rev to its nuclear export sequence becomes structured at some point in rev’s export function. overall, our study illustrates for the first time how these linker regions are closely involved in rev function either by direct functional roles or by more subtle regulatory roles. in sum, these experiments make evident rev’s extraordinary genetic robustness, which is achieved via the use of malleable macromolecular interaction surfaces spaced by even more malleable linker regions that can more finely tune those interactions.resultscompetitive deep mutational scanning (cdms) data recapitulates rev domain structurerev plays an essential role in the viral life cycle, coordinating the nuclear export of unspliced or partially spliced mrnas for translation of key viral proteins or encapsidation of full-length viral genomes. rev recognizes a ~350-nt structured rna within the intron known as the rev response element (rre) using an arginine-rich motif (arm) for binding, and forms an oligomeric assembly on the rre using two hydrophobic oligomerization motifs or domains (ods)11,12. this rev-rre complex then recruits the host nuclear export factor crm1, using a nuclear export sequence (nes) in rev, together with rangtp to transport these rnas to the cytoplasm and thereby circumvent splicing5,6.the three main functional regions of rev (arm, od, and nes) are flanked by linker regions13,14,15,16,17 (fig. 1a,b). the structure of the od is formed by the interaction of two od helices, where the second helix extends beyond the 15 residues of the helical arm15. the nes forms its structure upon binding to crm118. the regions that flank these functional domains include: a short n-terminal tail (n-term), a proline-rich turn between the first and second helices (turn), a linker between the second helix and the nes (od-nes linker: onl) and a long, disordered c-terminal tail (c-term)6,19 (fig. 1b).we utilized the fitness values for every possible rev allele derived from a competitive deep mutational scanning (cdms) dataset, where rev was engineered into non-overlapped viruses and all substitutions at individual positions were competitively replicated, to deduce functional signatures of amino acid selection10. these data are consistent with our current biochemical and structural understanding of rev, as we observe that the structured regions display low mutational tolerance (low median fitness in these regions indicates that only a few side chains are fit at each position) whereas the linker regions display high mutational tolerance (near-neutral median fitness indicates that almost all side chains are fit) (fig. 1b,c). the mutational plasticity of the linker regions is also apparent in the heat maps of all individual point mutations, further corroborating the underlying structural and functional boundaries (fig. 1b).the rev od is highly plastic at the sequence and structural levelswe first examined the amino acid requirements of the od in more detail. rev function requires binding of a homo-oligomer of 6–10 subunits to the rre11,12,19,20,21,22. the od is comprised of two helices which contain hydrophobic residues necessary both for oligomerization and for interacting with host proteins, such as hnrnps and rna helicases23,24,25,26. the od forms three hydrophobic surfaces with some residues shared between the surfaces: 1) a monomer stabilization interface in which side chains from each helix of the od (residues 19, 22, 52 and 59) stabilize the monomer structure of rev, 2) a dimer interface which supports formation of a rev dimer upon nucleation of rev assembly on the rre (residues 18, 22, 55 and 59 and residue 21 in one dimer configuration), and 3) a higher-order interface opposite the dimer interface which allows the formation of the larger rev oligomer (residues 12, 16 and 60)13,14,27,28 (fig. 2a).figure 2selection profile of hydrophobic residues for the rev oligomerization domain (od) in the cdms dataset10. (a) residues from the rev od involved in monomer, dimer or oligomer interface packing. structures from pdbid 3lph and 2 × 7 l were used to generate the images. (b) amino acid preferences for important rev od contact residues using cdms fitness values10. all residues display selection against polar/charged (c,s,t,q,n,d, e, h, r, k) residues (and stop codons) (green) while some prefer large, hydrophobic side chains (teal) over aromatics (blue). note change of scaling for y23.full size imageone very provocative feature of the rev od is that variation in the packing of its hydrophobic residues leads to multiple configurations of rev dimers and oligomers15,29,30. this structural plasticity underlies the ability of rev to assemble into an oligomeric complex on the rre and raises the question of how constrained these side chains must be. cdms data10 show that interaction residues in each interface display a general preference for hydrophobicity and size with occasional preference for aliphatic side chains over aromatic ones (fig. 2b). for instance, in the dimer interface, residues 22, 55, and 59 prefer large aliphatic side chains while aromatic substitutions are equally as fit as aliphatic ones at residue 19. similar patterns are seen in the higher-order oligomerization interface with residues 12 and 60 accepting any large hydrophobic, residues 16, 55 and 60 having distinct preferences for aliphatic residues. interestingly, residue 23, although not part of currently known oligomeric interface configurations, strongly prefers f or y (fig. 2b). in summary, this ability of the od to make functionally neutral mutations between chemically similar side chains (e.g. i, l & v and in some cases w, f, and y) at such functional critical positions increases the mutational robustness and prevents the “brittleness” that essential interfaces in other proteins can possess.the rev nes and arm balance fragility and plasticitythe rev arm serves as both the rre-binding domain as well as a nuclear localization signal (nls) through interactions with importin-β31. it can recognize diverse rna sites depending on the rna structure and the orientation/placement of arm residues15,20,32. additionally, residues in the arm also enhance the monomer core structure through hydrogen bonds13. given these numerous functional constraints, most residues of the arm, including the non-basic residues q36 and w45, show strong selection in the cdms study (fig. 3a). another residue, q51, implicated in stabilizing an rna-bound rev dimer through hydrogen bonds15 also shows strong selection, reaffirming its importance in rev-rre assembly.figure 3mutational limits of the rev arm and nes.

(f) viral replication profiles of viruses containing rev with nes mutations. data are mean ± s.d of biological triplicates.full size imagethe rev nes recruits crm1 to the rev-rre rnp, and recent em studies show that a crm1 dimer is associated with the rnp33. structural studies of a rev nes peptide bound to crm1 have shown that rev binds crm1 in a non-canonical manner (fig. 3b), using prolines to properly space hydrophobic residues to contact crm1. curiously, cdms data shows that p76, which contacts the crm1 binding groove, is as fit as a hydrophobic residue (l, i), whereas l75 prefers to be a proline (fig. 3c). furthermore, like the od, the hydrophobic residues in the nes that contact crm1 are tolerant of most large aliphatic side chains (fig. 3c,d).in order to further evaluate the effect of rev mutations within both the structured domains and linkers, we conducted a series of rna export reporter assays together with replication assays of non-overlapped mutant viruses to avoid the confounding effects of overlapping reading frames (fig. s1)10. the reporter assay monitors rev-dependent p24 capsid expression from a cmv promoter-driven truncated viral genome in 293 t cells34,35 and the replication assay utilizes rev-in-nef viruses as previously described10. the combination of assays also allows us to potentially uncover additional functions of rev in the replication context.we tested both rev l75p and p76l mutants for function in our reporter assay and observed only 60% activity (fig. 3e), while the corresponding viral spreads were comparable to wild-type rev, consistent with the cdms data (fig. 3f). these observations strongly indicate that rev is able to tolerate greater variability to mutation of crm1 binding residues than expected and that the loss of activity observed in our reporter assay is still above some functional minimum, or that other mechanisms, present in the context of viral replication, compensate for this loss of activity.the od, arm and nes are all structured, critical regions of rev, where a point mutation is often sufficient to abolish function. while our cdms data indicate that many residues of the od and nes are tolerant to substitutions, conferring mutational robustness/plasticity, the arm has more stringent sequence preferences. this may reflect the more complex nature of interactions mediated by the arm (polar, charged, directional as well as rna and protein), making it relatively more fragile than the od or nes.the n- and c-termini influence rev stabilitywhile the function of the arm, od and nes are fairly well understood, the roles of the linkers in rev function, apart from connecting the modules, is less clear. since most residues within these regions do not experience strong selection for a specific amino acid/category, point mutational datasets are insufficient to determine their sequence constraints. thus, we constructed a series of truncation and gross substitution mutations within these regions and measured their activities to interrogate their functions more rigorously.the n-terminal 8 residues of rev are disordered in most crystal structures (fig. 1b)13,14,15,29, but a recent structure of a scfv-bound rev solved at 2.3 å shows that the first helix begins at residue 5 (pdb id: 5dhv)29. genetic screens and selection assays have identified residue 12 as the first essential contact in the rev od27,28. the presence of an overlapping reading frame encoding the critical arm of tat, another essential viral protein, has confounded conservation analyses of the rev n-terminus. indeed, previous work suggests that this region does not experience strong selective pressure (excluding requirements for translation initiation), but is well conserved in rev in order to maintain tat function10.to more fully investigate the role of n-terminus of rev, we measured the effects of truncations in our export assay. deleting the first 10 residues (rev ∆1–10) had no effect on activity whereas any further truncation resulted in loss of activity (fig. 4a). replication spreads of viruses containing these truncations recapitulated the export results, with the virus expressing rev ∆1–10 replicating similar to the wild-type rev virus, whereas the rev ∆1–11 virus failed to replicate (fig. 4b). these results corroborate that the first 10 residues of rev are not required for function.figure 4the hiv-1 rev n-terminus is not required for function but regulates rev stability.

(g) c-terminal truncations affect rev expression/stability from hiv-1 (with flag-tagged rev in the nef locus) in infected t-cells. plot shows virus production from cell supernatant, quantified by p24 elisa. western blots below show protein expression for flag-tagged rev and gapdh loading control from the cells. the original blot for the cropped bands is shown in fig. s5. data are mean ± s.d of biological replicates.full size imagec-terminal truncations (rev 1–85, rev 1–83) are functional in our reporter and replication assays, further confirming that this region is dispensable for function, while truncation of a single residue in the nes (rev 1–82) results in a dramatic loss of function (fig. 5c,d). similar to the n-terminal truncations, we were unable to detect rev protein with c-terminal truncations despite functional reporter activity, with no significant change in the stability of truncated-rev mrna (fig. s2b), and observed low levels of truncated rev in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, mg132 (fig. 5e). however, unlike the n-terminus, smaller truncations did not restore rev expression as 1–85, 1–90 and 1–100 all express poorly (fig. 5f). intriguingly, previous studies of c-terminal truncations in cos cells did not result in reduced protein stability38. rev 1–85 also displayed reduced stability in virus-infected t-cells, although the virus replicates as well as the wild-type rev virus (fig. 5g). thus, the c-terminus, like the n-terminus, is not required for rna export or viral replication but regulates protein stability in a manner whose mechanism and functional consequence are not yet understood.substitutions to the rev turn produce different effects on rna export and viral replicationrev contains an 8-residue proline rich turn which separates the first two helices and spans the exon junction in the viral genome (fig. 1a,c). recent structural studies implicate the turn residues as part of an additional rev-rev interaction surface where residues w45, p28, p29 and p31 “hook” with the same residues on an adjacent rev molecule. this interface has been proposed to act as a molecular bridge between independent oligomerization events along the rre29,30. most residues in the turn do not have strong preferences in the cdms study (fig. 1b)10, consistent with our understanding of the region as a simple linker. however, residue 28 demonstrated a strong preference for an aromatic side chain (w,f,y) rather than the reference nl4–3 proline (p) (fig. s3). interestingly, the most common allele in patient sequences is y28, although p28 is also substantially represented and is found in many lab-adapted hiv-1 strains43. it is possible that a p28y substitution could provide stacking interactions to stabilize this aromatic interface within the turn30, but we found no significant difference in activity between the proline and tyrosine variants (fig. s3). even an alanine substitution at position 28 is only marginally weaker in replication assays, indicating substantial sequence plasticity, but leaving the manner in which y28 confers a fitness advantage in competition experiments and in patients still unclear. nevertheless, given that the turn appeared mutationally plastic in our cdms studies and since it also determines the relative orientation of the first two helices, we examined its mutational limits with respect to side chain preference, length and structure.to this end, we created a set of mutations that replaced the turn residues (26–33) with either all alanines (turn-8a, designed to promote helical propensity44) or glycines and serines (turn-8gs, designed to allow greater flexibility), and monitored the effects on rev function in both reporter and replication assays. surprisingly, we found that both variants yielded significant levels of export in the reporter assay (fig. 6a) although neither was as active as wild-type rev. however, shortening the length of the substitutions reduced export activity indicating that the turn must be of sufficient length to connect the two helices and produce functional rev.figure 6the turn plays an intriguing role in rev function (a) reporter assay monitoring function of rev constructs with mass substitution of turn residues 26–33. data are mean ± standard deviation (s.d) of biological replicates. western blots below show protein expression for strep-tagged rev and gapdh as loading control. numbers above blots represent quantified band intensities for rev mutants relative to wt-rev. the turn-5a mutant shows reduced rev expression suggesting that it might be less stable than the other mutants.

(a) reporter assay monitoring export function of rev constructs with mass substitution of onl residues 62–72. data are mean ± standard deviation (s.d) of biological replicates. western blots below showing protein expression for strep-tagged rev and gapdh loading control and numbers above blots represent quantified band intensities for rev mutants relative to wt-rev. (b) corresponding viral replication spread experiments. viral p24 levels below 1000 pg/ml are shown as 1000 pg/ml in the plots for illustration purposes. data are mean ± s.d of biological triplicates.

this behavior likely went undetected previously as prior approaches, such as our point mutational cdms, typically examined the effect of individual point mutations, which alone appear insufficient to disrupt the induced structure.discussion hiv rev has been extensively investigated over three decades. structural studies over the past several years have led to a model in which rev is composed of a few highly conserved, structured regions with well-defined functions that are connected by disordered linkers (fig. 1a). the results presented here expand the functional repertoire to these linker regions. indeed, recent work in other systems has demonstrated the importance of disordered and linker regions for establishing and tuning protein interactions46,47,48, and particularly for modulating rna-protein interactions49.the use of disordered linkers to tune rev function may reflect some of the selective pressures imposed by having its entire coding sequence overlapped with other hiv-1 genes, specifically tat and env (fig. 1a). in previous work, we observed a complete segregation of function within the overlapped region of tat and rev, where the overlapped nucleotides encoded amino acids critical for the function of one protein or the other, but never both. furthermore, the genetically fragile activation domain of tat is encoded in a non-overlapped portion of the tat gene, consistent with the idea that brittle domains in which many mutations are expected to be lethal are unlikely to evolve within regions that must simultaneously maintain two overlapping coding sequences. since rev overlaps with other genes over its entire sequence, it apparently evolved relatively mutable interaction surfaces, such as the od, to create genetic stability. the linker regions modulate rev function and stability yet are even more mutable and as a result are effectively segregated at the coding level, imposing few constraints on the other reading frames.truncations of the n- and c-termini revealed that these regions greatly influence rev protein stability, yet have little effect on rev function in the context of our cellular reporter and replication assays. proteomics studies have reported similar protein interaction profiles for n-terminal rev truncations (∆1–8) and wild-type rev25, indicating that n-terminus likely does not serve as a major interaction scaffold. however the n-terminus can be phosphorylated50, and may have regulatory effects that effect the function and/or stability of the protein in patient viral replication settings.intriguingly, the cdms data suggest a fitness advantage to c-terminal truncations and thus a possible inhibitory role (fig. 5a,b). a recent study proposed that the rev nes can be masked in the cytoplasm, controlling rev trafficking in and out of the nucleus36. we speculate that removing c-terminal residues might decrease the masking and thereby promote export of viral rnas to provide a fitness advantage. conversely, we observe that truncation of the c-terminus decreases protein stability, which might seem to negate any gains to export activity, however very little rev is required for function, excessive amounts of rev can lead to reduced export activity (fig. s2), and viruses harboring undetectable amounts of rev can replicate well (figs 4e, 5g). hence, it appears that truncating the c-terminus might increase fitness by reducing rev levels to a more optimal level. however, we note that our viral replication experiments are performed with rev-in-nef, and nef transcripts are nearly two-fold more abundant than rev transcripts51,52. therefore, some of the mutants with unaffected replication but reduced rev stabilities might be compensated for via increased expression of rev from the nef locus. expression of truncated rev from its endogenous locus might reveal the true limits for rev expression and viral replication. however, the rev c-terminus entirely overlaps with env (fig. 1a), and selection pressure from the env reading frame (either functional requirements or immune targeting of specific env epitopes) can influence rev sequence and make stop codons unfavorable at most positions.the rev c-terminus length varies considerably amongst hiv-1 isolates (fig. s4). apart from the most common 116-amino acid form of rev, some are 123 amino acids long due to a qsqgtet insertion between residues 95 and 96; other isolates carry this insertion as well as a premature stop codon and produce a truncated, 107-amino acid rev. insertion of the qsqgtet sequence reduces export activity (fig. s4), further suggesting that a long c-terminus inhibits spread, although further studies will be needed to reveal the exact mechanism and functional consequences of rev c-terminus length.given rev’s role in regulating hiv kinetics, multiple mechanisms might fine-tune rev function within the context of replication. indeed, the logic of gene expression networks involving rev continues to be of major interest to the hiv community, and has major implications for the mechanisms of hiv latency53,54,55. our findings on rev stability in a cell culture system therefore provide important parameters and considerations for future studies dedicated to deciphering viral kinetics and decoupling the selective pressures of rev function from other selective pressures of viral replication in more complex systems.the turn between the helices of rev is highly mutable but does have certain requirements of length and flexibility. the ability of the turn-8gs mutant to export well in the reporter assay yet fail to replicate suggests that this region may perform additional roles in viral replication. alternately, the different results in different contexts could also be because of the cell types (and possibly, host factors for rev interaction) used for reporter assays (293 t cells, transformed kidney cells) and viral replication assays (supt1 cells, lymphoblastic t-cells). in any case, these results suggest that the turn may form an important functional interface. recent structural studies have determined that the turn can form a homotypic interaction interface29,30, and mutations expected to stabilize this interface (p28y) are enriched in both our cdms data and patient data10. further characterization will be required to determine the exact role of this interface and more generally the turn itself, in rev function.similarly, our manipulation of the onl uncovered that it does not tolerate replacements that increase its propensity for disorder, suggesting that it becomes structured during some step of export complex formation. since this stretch of residues can be replaced with alanines without significant loss of function, it appears that these residues do not form a specific interaction surface, but instead play a structural role, in which the specific sequence itself is unimportant as long as the region can adopt a presumably helical structure. negative-stain electron microscopy has shown that a crm1 dimer binds to the rev-rre complex with the two nes-binding grooves distinctly positioned to associate with two ness from the complex33. a structured onl might reduce the entropic penalty associated with crm1 assembly and also fix ness into a favorable orientation for this interaction, thereby improving the energetics of export complex formation.to examine how a structured onl might impact rev-rre-crm1 complex formation, we re-visited previous models for rev-rre-crm1 complex assembly15. given the established plasticity in rre structure and the hydrophobic rev interaction surfaces, we proposed earlier that these features allow rev-rre complexes with varying sequences to adopt configurations favorable for crm1 recruitment and nuclear export15. adding the requirement that the od-nes linker needs to be structured (helical with the limitations imposed by two prolines in the nl4–3 sequence), we built a model of a rev monomer containing residues 5–83 (fig. 8a), where 83 is the last residue of the nes, from the structures of rev (5dhv)30 and a rev nes-crm1 complex (3nbz)17 using chimera56. previous studies established a hexamer of rev on a minimal, functional 240 nucleotide rre19. therefore, we built three representative rev hexamers using rev 5–83 as described previously15 and aligned the nes from one rev subunit in the hexamer to a rev-nes peptide bound to crm1 in a model of crm1-dimer-rev-nes complex33 (fig. 8b,c). four main aspects become apparent from these models: (1) with more structured residues of rev past its second helix, only a subset of hexamers are plausible due to steric clashes of the rev c-terminus with other rev subunits, the rre or crm1 (fig. 8c, left panel); (2) the rna-bound rev dimer, with its narrow crossing angle of 50° between subunits, places the two ness in a nearly favorable configuration to associate with a crm1 dimer (fig. 8c, left and right panels); (3) different hexamer configurations can recruit crm1 dimers using different combinations of rev subunits (fig. 8c); and (4) in some hexamer configurations, more than one nes is positioned close to an nes-binding groove in one of the crm1 subunits (fig. 8c, right panel). given that the rre enhances rev binding to crm133, these configurations may in fact be the dominant class of hexamers, forming an ensemble of nuclear export complexes wherein multiple ness may associate with crm1 in a variety of orientations57,58,59. in this way, the structuring of the onl may restrict the possible orientations of rev-rre hexamers to a subset of export-competent configurations.figure 8models of hiv-1 rev 5–83 and potential interactions of rev hexamers with a crm1 dimer. (a) model of hiv-1 rev 5–83 built using chimera. (b) model of a crm1 dimer bound to rev nes (from33) (c) three representative rev hexamers generated using rev 5–83 and dimerization and oligomerization surfaces (as in15). rev subunits are colored from blue (subunit 1) to red (subunit 6). different rev nes sequences were aligned with one of the crm1-bound rev-nes peptide: nes1 from the first panel, nes6 from the second and nes 1 from the third panel. we then observed which other rev nes sequences were in close proximity to the second crm1-bound rev-nes peptide.full size imageby our systematic analysis of each region of rev, we conclude that every region of the protein influences its function, structure, or stability, consistent with optimal usage of limited genetic information. in the context of the viral genome and its overlapped reading frames, the virus is able to segregate essential functional and structural motifs and yet further tune rev function using linker regions with relatively relaxed sequence and length requirements10. indeed, recent analyses of rev-like proteins in other retroviruses suggest that many key structural features - such as the key hydrophobic residues in the od – remain conserved even as the primary sequence diverged60. thus, the nuclear export function of rev can be achieved through a wide variety of sequence configurations. furthermore, our experiments, as well as studies of patient isolates61, have demonstrated a wide range of rev activity and expression levels, providing evidence of an additional levels of robustness beyond the mutational plasticity that governs protein stability and interactions studied in this work.this study and others62,63,64 show that reporter and replication assays largely correlate, suggesting that rna export activity is the major role of rev in the viral life cycle; however it is interesting that some rev mutants exhibit different behaviors. for example, rev l75p, p76l, and onl-9a all have lowered reporter activities (40–60% of wild-type rev) but are completely replication competent. conversely, turn-8gs has export phenotype comparable to the above constructs but is completely defective for replication. these results illustrate that not all export defects lead to viral replication defects, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms may exist to compensate for these defects, and that reporter export activity does not always fully explain the role of rev in the viral life cycle, raising the possibility that rev may possess still unknown functions. other roles for rev, such as regulating splicing65, translation66,67,68 and encapsidation69,70,71 of rre-containing messages have been reported as well as other interactions with host partners26,72,73,74,75, and many of the mutants described here may help elucidate those roles.future work in the endogenous hiv-1 genomic context, as well as a variety of infectable cell types may shed light on these questions and reveal additional evolutionary constraints that shape rev’s robustness. such work will require careful design as the kinetics of rev expression and viral spread within an organism are complex, and are regulated on multiple levels. in many of these systems, selective forces do not necessarily act to produce only a high viral titer as they do in cell culture models. the work presented here should prove valuable in deconvoluting the functional consequences of mutations in these more complex systems. in sum, our results add to an increasingly mature structural picture of rev macromolecular complexes and demonstrate that large-scale mutagenesis approaches combined with targeted assays and structural knowledge can reveal novel and subtle mutational constraints in even well-studied systems.materials and methodsconstruction of mutantsprimers harboring the appropriate mutations were chemically synthesized (idt) and then used in a 2-step pcr reaction and inserted into pcdna4to-2xstrep-rev (invitrogen mammalian expression vector, described in10) via gibson assembly for testing in export assays. a similar strategy was undertaken to make viral mutants in a rev-in-nef virus as described previously10,15.cells and mediahek293t cells were maintained in dmem, high glucose (with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°c and 5% co2. supt1 cells were maintained in rpmi (with 25 mm hepes ph 7.4, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°c and 5% co2.rev reporter assaysreporter assays to monitor rev export activity were carried out in hek 293 t cells (from atcc) by transient transfection. in a typical experiment, 293 t cells in a 24-well plate were transfected with 250 ng of a pcmv-gagpol-rre reporter construct35, 25 ng of pcdna4to-2xstrep-rev (invitrogen mammalian expression vector) (or indicated amount) and 10 ng pcdna4to-firefly luciferase (to monitor transfection efficiency) using polyjet transfection reagent (signagen). we chose these quantities for rev plasmid to maintain accuracy in plasmid concentrations across different constructs and for easily detectable protein expression. forty-eight hours after transfection, the culture supernatant was removed, the cells were lysed in tris-buffered saline containing 1% triton x-100 and protease inhibitors, and intracellular gag (p24) was quantified by elisa. rev expression levels were verified by western blot using hrp-conjugated-anti-streptagii antibody (iba biosciences) with gapdh used as a loading control. blots were detected by chemi-luminescence using chemidoc (biorad); exposure times were adjusted so that the signal was not saturated and bands were quantified using imagej76. band intensities were in the linear range for these exposure conditions and for the rev quantities used in our experiments (fig. s2). for experiments with mg132, 2.5 um proteasome inhibitor mg132 was added 30 hours after transfection and cells were harvested 16 hours later.measuring cytoplasmic gagpol mrna levelsin order to confirm that the p24 levels quantified by elisa report mainly on rev’s nuclear export function and not because of any effects of rev on gag translation, we quantified cytoplasmic gagpol mrna levels in the presence of some of our rev mutants (fig. s1). 293 t cells in a 24-well plate were transfected with 250 ng of a pcmv-gagpol-rre reporter construct, 2.5 ng of pcdna4to-2xstrep-rev (or indicated rev mutant) and 10 ng pcdna4to-firefly luciferase using polyjet transfection reagent (signagen). as described above in rev reporter assays. 24 hours post transfection, the culture supernatant was aspirated, cells were detached using dpbs containing 5 mm edta, washed twice in ice-cold dpbs. to lyse the plasma membrane, cells were resuspended gently by flicking in 175 ul of ice-cold buffer rln (50 mm tris.cl ph 8.0, 140 mm nacl, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5% nonidet p-40). following a 5-minute incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 300xg for 2 minutes at 4°c and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was used for rna extraction using the qiagen rneasy kit. dnase treatment and rt-pcr reactions were set up using the biorad iscript gdna clear cdna synthesis kit. relative rna abundance was quantified by qpcr and the gagpolrre mrna levels were normalized to gapdh mrna levels (fig. s1b). primers used for qpcr were:gagpolrre-f: 5′ ggaaacatggtggacagagtat 3′gagpolrre-r: 5′ ctgctcctactatgggttctttc 3′gapdh-f: 5′ gtctcctctgacttcaacagcg 3′gapdh-r: 5′ accaccctgttgctgtagccaa 3′.viral replication assaysrev mutants were cloned into the nef region of a nl4–3 proviral construct, mutated to ensure no expression from the endogenous rev locus15. for generation of viruses, hek 293 t cells in a 6 well plate were transfected with 1000 ng of nl4–3 proviral plasmid and 20 ng of pcdna4to-rev to promote robust production of viruses containing rev mutations. virus supernatants were collected 48 hours after transfection, quantified by p24 capsid elisa and stored in aliquots at −80 °c. for viral replication assays, one million supt1 cells were inoculated with 5 ng of p24 virus in 250 ul media containing 1 ug/ml pei and 8 ug/ml polybrene and centrifuged for 2 hours at 37 °c. input virus was removed, cells were washed once with 250 ul of pbs, resuspended in 250 ul of media and placed in an incubator at 37 °c, 5% co215. 100 ul of virus-containing supernatants were collected every 48–72 hours for 20 days (and equivalent amounts of fresh media were added to cells) for quantification by p24 elisa. we wish to note that the replication kinetics of an nl4–3 reference virus and an nl4–3 rev-in-nef virus are different, with both viruses displaying peak infection at different times (fig. s1). this is likely due differences in timing and abundance of rev-encoding messages from an endogenous rev locus and a rev-in-nef locus.to monitor expression of rev-flag during viral replication, rev-flag, rev δ1–8-flag and rev 1–85-flag were cloned into the nef locus of a nl4–3 proviral construct and viruses were generated as above. three million supt1 cells (nih aids reagent program) were infected with 150 ng of p24 (viral capsid) in a total volume of 6 ml containing 1 ug/ml pei and 8 ug/ml polybrene and centrifuged for 2 hours at 37 °c at 1200xg15. input virus was removed, cells were washed with 5 ml of dpbs and resuspended in 6 ml of media (rpmi supplemented with 25 mm hepes ph 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. 1.25 ml of cells were withdrawn on days 1–4 post infection, lysed in ripa buffer (20 mm tris-cl ph 6.4, 140 mm nacl, 1% np-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sds), containing protease inhibitors and flag-tagged rev was detected by western blot (mouse anti-flag antibody, sigma) with gapdh used as a loading control. blots were detected by chemi-luminescence by exposure to an x-ray film (>8 minute long exposures were necessary to detect rev).rev mrna stability analysis293 t cells in a 24-well plate were transfected as described above in rev reporter assays. 18 hours post transfection, the culture supernatant was aspirated, cells were detached using dpbs containing 5 mm edta, washed twice in ice-cold dpbs and the pelleted cell volume (pcv) was measured. the cells were then washed once in 3x pcv of buffer a (10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0 1.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm kcl, 0.5 mm dtt, 0.2u/ul murine rnase inhibitor (new england biolabs)) and resuspended in 5x pcv of buffer a. after 10 minutes, triton x-100 was added to the cells to a final concentration of 0.5%, the cells were passed through a 25 g needle and then centrifuged at 4500 g x g, 5 minutes. the supernatant was used for rna extraction using the zymo quick-rna mini prep kit with dnase treatment. rt-pcr reactions were set up using the biorad iscript select cdna synthesis kit using oligo (dt) primers. rna abundance was quantified by qpcr and the rev mrna levels were normalized to gapdh mrna levels. primers used for qpcr were:rev-f: 5′ gacaggcccgaaggaatag 3′rev-r: 5′ cgcagatcgtcccagataag 3′gapdh-f: 5′ gtctcctctgacttcaacagcg 3′gapdh-r: 5′ accaccctgttgctgtagccaa 3′.cdms analysisfitness values from previous work10, representing selection strength based on population genetics modeling and changes in allele frequencies during viral competition assays, were used to display the preferences of each amino acid at each position. to determine each position’s general hydrophobic preferences, we grouped these fitness values into related bins (e.g. w,f,y) and plotted their distributions.patient isolate analysisanalysis of patient sequences was performed in a manner as previously described10. specifically, we downloaded high-quality, curated protein alignments from the publicly available los alamos hiv sequence compendium (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/) and calculated amino acid conservation for every position in rev, representing 2,694 rev sequences. gaps not found in the reference hxb2 sequence were discounted from the analysis. patient sequences consist of only viral sequences and no patient-specific information.analysis of stop codon fitnessdata from our cdms experiments10 were used to generate distributions of rev residues 1–86 (position 86 was chosen as it is the most c-terminal position which displays selection against the stop codon), rev residues 87–116, and tat positions 66–86 (position 66 was chosen as it is the most n-terminal position in tat that displays neutral or positive fitness for the stop codon). distributions were plotted in r using ggplot2’s density function smoothed with a bandwidth adjustment parameter of 1 (adjust = 1).

Seroprevalence of six pathogens transmitted by the Ixodes ricinus ticks in asymptomatic individuals with HIV infection and in blood donors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38755-9,Research,14 February 2019,yes,"the objective of our study was to estimate the seroprevalence of six pathogens transmitted by ticks in hiv-infected persons and blood donors in poland (b. burgdorferi s.l., a. phagocytophilum, ehrlichia spp., babesia spp., rickettsia spp. bartonella henselae) to assess the frequency of exposure to such microorganisms in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals in endemic regions for i. ricinus ticks. serum samples were collected from 227 hiv-infected patients and 199 blood donors. all samples were analyzed for antibodies against six tick-borne pathogens and seroprevalence rates were statistically compared between two tested group as well as age, sex and lymphocyte t cd4+ level in hiv infected patients. the seroprevalence of tick-borne infections in hiv-infected patients is higher than that of the healthy population in poland, although no association between serological status of patients and lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level has been observed. the frequency of tick-borne coinfections and doubtful results of serological tests were significantly higher in hiv-positive individuals. in poland, the possibility of tick-borne diseases transmission with blood is rather negligible.
introduction recently the experts of the center for disease control and prevention’s have summarized the alarming increase in the number of vector-borne disease cases reported in the united states and territories from 2004 to 20161. of the almost 650,000 cases, over 491,000 were tick-borne. however, tick-borne diseases are a large and growing public health problem not only in the united states but also in europe2. ixodes ricinus is the most widespread tick species in europe and constitutes the vector of numerous pathogens, especially borrelia burgdorferi sl. and borrelia myiamotoi, anaplasma phagocytophilum, tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev), babesia spp., as well as some rickettsia and ehrlichia species3,4,5,6. lyme borreliosis (lb) is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, and about 85,000 cases are reported annually in europe7. the estimated incidence of lb in poland increased dramatically from 20.3 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2007 to 56.0 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 (an estimated average increased from 7,735 cases per year in 2007 to 21,516 cases per year in 2017)8. as of today, there are about 100 confirmed or probable cases of anaplasmosis and about 60 cases of babesiosis in europe9,10, including poland11,12,13. the rickettsia infections and single cases of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (hge) have been also noted in europe14,15. recent data suggest that ticks could also transmit bartonella henselae to human16,17,18,19. immunocompetent individuals with tick-borne infections may present with non-specific symptoms, such as fever and a flu-like disease which usually abate spontaneously within a few weeks9,15,20,21. nevertheless, severe infections in immunocompetent humans have been also noted22,23,24. furthermore, asymptomatic tick-borne infections in healthy persons may constitute threats to the safety of the blood supply25,26. however, in individuals with immunologically compromising conditions, including hiv-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1)-positive patients, tick-borne pathogens may cause chronic, debilitating opportunistic infection and even death27,28,29,30,31,32.patients diagnosed with hiv-1 are immunodeficient, which is a significant risk factor for diseases caused by specific pathogens, namely those expanding due to the lower level of t lymphocyte (lt) cd4+ cells, since pathogenicity often depends on cellular and humoral immune responses33. in poland, since 1985, there have been about 22,000 new cases of hiv infection8. as the positive predictive value of serological tests is reduced, in hiv-positive patients diagnostics based on such methods used to be cumbersome34. improvement in treatment efficacy has resulted in better immune system function of the majority of hiv-positive patients; another consequence has been a significant increase in the positive predictive value (ppv) risk of serology-based methods. prognosis for patients with hiv-1 has improved pronouncedly since the commencement of haart (highly active antiretroviral therapy) which involves both antiretroviral drugs and efficient regimens. consequently, hiv-infected individuals have greater chance of living actively, yet engaging in outdoor activities is a risk factor for tick infestation35,36. until now, there have been only a few studies concerning occurrence of tick-borne diseases in hiv-positive patients, in contrast to other infections associated with the same virus. additionally, the studies that had been conducted were analyses of mainly single clinical cases, and only babesia, borrelia, a. phagocytophilum and rickettsia have been detected in hiv-infected individuals in europe so far, out of the broad spectrum of tick-borne pathogens37,38,39,40.the objective of our study was to estimate the seroprevalence of six pathogens transmitted by ticks (b. burgdorferi s.l., a. phagocytophilum, ehrlichia spp., babesia spp., rickettsia spp. bartonella henselae) in hiv-infected persons and blood donors (representing the control group) in poland, to assess the frequency of exposure to such microorganisms in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals in endemic regions for i. ricinus ticks41. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first serological study on the occurrence of the most common pathogens transmitted by ticks in hiv-1-infected humans.resultsdescription of the tested group of patients/blood donorsof the 227 hiv-infected patients included in the study, the medical data (lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level, plasma hiv rna level, haart therapy, age and sex, risk group [msm, injection drug user]) were obtained from 148 patients. in this group, with the mean age of 33 years (range 20–51 years), men predominated (140 patients, 95%). the median lymphocyte cd4+ t cell count was 465/µl with 19% of patients with less than 300/µl. most of these patients (82%; n = 121) were on haart.of the 199 blood donors, 134 men and 65 women were included with the mean age of 36 (range 18–71 years). the majority of participants (95%; n = 190) inhabit urban areas, however, 32% of them (n = 63) declared contact with ticks, mainly in natural areas (forest). lyme borreliosis was diagnosed and then treated in the last 10 years in 9 participants (4.5%).borrelia burgdorferi s.l. seroprevalenceof the 227 hiv-infected patients tested for b. burgdorferi s.l. specific igm and igg by elisa test, 66 and 11 were positive, respectively, which corresponds to the seroprevalence rate of 29.1% for igm and 4.8% for igg (table 1). among 199 serum samples collected from blood donors, 26 (13.1%) for igm and 10 (5.0%) for igg were positive, respectively. the igm seroprevalence noted in hiv-infected patients was significantly higher compared to seroprevalence observed in blood donors (29.1% vs. 13.1%; χ2 = 16.58, df = 1, p = 0.0001); however, igg seroprevalence did not differ statistically between these two groups (table 1).table 1

donors in poland.full size tableall positive results of elisa tests were confirmed by western blot. out of the igm and igg elisa-positive samples of hiv infected patients, half were confirmed in wb (50% [33/66] and 53.8% [6/11] for igm and igg, respectively). statistically lower igm elisa positive results were confirmed in wb in blood donors (23.1% [6/26]; χ2 = 4.49, df = 1, p = 0.034). however, of the 10 igg elisa positive results, 8 (80%) were confirmed in wb (statistically not significant).due to a sufficient number of b. burgdorferi seropositive cases in wb for hiv-positive patients, the effect of sex, age and lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level on seroprevalence were estimated. igm seroprevalence increased significantly with age, reaching a maximum of 36.8% for patients aged >35 years (<25 years: 0%; 25–35 years: 11.1%; χ2 = 7.84, df = 2, p = 0.0001). igg seroprevalence noted for patients aged 25–35 years was almost twice as low as in patients aged >35 years (2.8% vs. 5.3%; no statistical differences). no statistical difference of seroprevalence between men and women was observed (igm: 15.3% vs 10.0%; igg: 2.8% vs. 0.0%, respectively). borrelia igm and igg seroprevalence were higher in hiv-infected patients with lymphocyte cd4+ t cell count less than 300/µl (igm: 19.2% vs. 12.5%; igg: 3.8% vs. 1.8%, no statistical differences) (fig. 1).figure 1seroprevalence of anti-borrelia burgdorferi s.l. antibodies in hiv-infected patients with median lymphocyte cd4+ t cell count <or >300/μl.full size imagebabesia microti seroprevalencethe igm seroprevalence was about 9 times higher in hiv-infected patients (9.3%; 21/227) than in blood donors (1.0%; 2/199) (χ2 = 16.65, df = 1, p = 0.0001) (table 1). babesia igg seroprevalence did not differ statistically between hiv-positive patients and blood donors (2.2% [5/227] vs. 1.5% [3/199]). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of the tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.anaplasma phagocytophilum seroprevalencethe igm and igg seroprevalence was similar in hiv-infected patients and blood donors (igm: 2.6% [6/227] vs. 3.0% [6/199], igg: 2.6% [6/227] vs. 1.5% [3/199], respectively) (table 1). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of the tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.ehrlichia chaffeensis seroprevalenceof the 227 hiv-positive patients tested for ehrlichia, 4 (1.8%; 4/227) were positive for specific igm (table 1). the igm seroprevalence in blood donors was 2.5 times higher (4.5%; 9/199), but this difference was not statistically significant. nevertheless, igg seroprevalence noted in hiv-infected patients was significantly higher compared to seroprevalence observed in blood donors (7.0% [16/227] vs. 2.5% [5/199]; χ2 = 4.93, df = 1, p = 0.026). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of the tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.bartonella

(table 1). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of the tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.rickettsia spotted-fever group seroprevalencethe igg seroprevalence for rickettsia sfg did not differ significantly between hiv-positive patients and blood donors (1.8% [4/227] vs. 1.0% [2/199]). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of the tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.multiple seropositivesamong 227 hiv-positive patients who were tested for six tick-borne pathogens, the igm serology was positive for a single pathogen in 26.0% (59/227) and for two pathogens in 3.1% (7/227), especially b. microti together with b. burgdorferi (3/7) or b. henselae (2/7) and a. phagocytophilum with b. henselae (1/7) or e. chaffeensis (1/7) (fig. 2). the igm seroprevalence rate was significantly lower in blood donors in whom a single pathogen was noted in 9.5% (19/199) and two pathogens in 1.5% (3/199), in all cases a. phagocytophilum with e. chaffeenisis were involved (χ2 = 22.01, df = 2, p = 0.001).figure 2seroprevalence of specific antibodies in single infection and coinfection with two pathogens in hiv-infected patients and blood donors in poland.full size imagethe rate of igg seroprevalence of a single pathogen was similar in hiv-positive patients and blood donors (11.5% [26/227] vs. 11.1% [22/199]). however, the infections of two pathogens were noted only in hiv-infected patients (3.1%; 7/227) (χ2 = 8.96, df = 2, p = 0.011): a. phagocytophilum with e. chaffeenisis (6/7) and one case of rickettsia with b. henselae (fig. 2). no significant association was demonstrated between the serological status of tested group of patients/participants and age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients.doubtful resultsthe frequency of doubtful results was significantly higher in hiv-infected patients than in blood donors (table 2). in hiv-positive patients the doubtful results for a. phagocytophilum were 9.7% and 6.2%, for e. chaffeensis- 4.4% and 6.6%, for b. henselae- 2.6% and 2.2% for igm and igg tests, respectively, whereas the doubtful results for these pathogens were not noted in blood donors. for b. burgdorferi igm elisa test, the amount of doubtful results was similar in both tested groups of patients/participants. in hiv-positive patients, the doubtful results for b. burgdorferi igg elisa test were observed more often (2.6% vs. 0.5%); however, this difference was not statistically significant.table 2 the frequency of doubtful results in hiv-infected patients and blood donors in poland.full size tablediscussion the large population of immunocompromised patients, including those with hiv/aids, is constantly growing. analysis of the published reports of tick-borne infections shows that the disease in immunocompromised patients is far more severe, prolonged and more likely to be fatal9,14,28. thus far, investigations of the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogen infections involving serological studies have concentrated on inhabitants of endemic regions who were healthy and whose immunological function was normal. by contrast to those studies or to reviews of clinical findings concerning hospitalized patients, our molecular and retrospective study had a different objective: establishing both the incidence and seroprevalence of tick-borne infections in patients with hiv, compared with the control group of healthy blood donors without clinical symptoms. both groups were based in an endemic area of i. ricinus ticks, namely poland. the polish society of epidemiology and infectious diseases has issued a recommendation regarding diagnostics of tick-borne diseases to which this study particularly conforms.in hiv-positive patients, borreliosis is rarely reported as co-infection, with only a few cases so far28,42. most of them were identified early, with neuroborreliosis confirmed in dutch and swedish patients. our recent molecular study confirmed the asymptomatic b. garinii infection in an hiv-postitive patient with no signs of early or late-stage lyme borreliosis40. borrelia burgdorferi was the predominant pathogen in our study, and about 30% and 5% of hiv-infected individuals were recorded as positive for igm and igg, respectively. in this group of patients, the igm seroprevalence rate was significantly higher compared to blood donors. the significantly higher b. burgdorferi seroprevalence was observed in hiv-infected patients aged >35 years and with a median lymphocyte cd4+ t cell less than 300/μl. to the best of our knowledge, as of today, only one serological study of borrelia infection in hiv-postitive patients was conducted, and the results were comparable – a total of 33% sera were positive43. antigens of borrelia and treponema spirochetes often cross-react with each other. false positive results of serologic tests have been obtained in neurological patients with infections with other bacteria in the same group, for instance t. pallidum42,44. therefore, our positive results of igm and igg elisa tests were confirmed by western blot according to the european guidelines45 in order to exclude false positive results. only half of positive elisa results were confirmed in wb in hiv-positive patients. accordingly, our data strongly recommends confirmatory testing in hiv-infected patients with elisa positive lyme screening.borrelia seroprevalence among blood donors in europe does not exceed 10%46,47,48. in our study, the igm and igg seroplevalence in elisa tests were rather similar (13.1% and 5.0%), and 23% (igm) and 80% (igg) of positive/doubtful results were confirmed in wb, respectively. all blood donors with anti-borrelia igg antibodies underwent borreliosis in the last 10 years. it is difficult to determine whether tested blood donors were spirochetemic at the time of blood giving, yet most of them declared multiple blood donation in the last decade. till now, there are only limited and conflicting data on the number of spirochetes in the blood of spirochetemic lyme disease patients49,50. however, as spirochetemia may occur in lyme disease, the potential for transfusion-transmitted b. burgdorferi exists but has yet to be reported51. ginzburg and co-authors have postulated that host-adapted b. burgdorferi survives poorly under blood storage conditions, particularly if the number of organisms per milliliter of human blood is low. we have not confirmed the presence of b. burgdorferi dna in the blood of the tested group of donors (data not published) and, therefore, we conclude that the risk of transfusion-transmitted b. burgdorferi is rather negligible.babesia is transmitted primarily by ixodid ticks, although blood transfusion is another important cause of infection52. to date, babesiosis in hiv-infected individuals has been observed in the united states of america53,54, yet one case has been also recorded in europe (spain)29. in those cases, the phase of infection was determined as chronic since it lasted several months. relapses of babesiosis occurred despite treatment which because of high parasitemia involved blood transfusions54. it is worth to note that recent studies have identified the first case of false-positive hiv serology that was associated with active babesiosis, yet after successful treatment of babesiosis, the positive hiv serology turned negative55. currently, there is no data on babesia seroprevalence in hiv-positive individuals. in our study, the igm b. microti seroprevalence in hiv-positive patients was significantly higher than among blood donors whose estimated igm and igg seroprevalence (<2%) was comparable to that reported for b. microti among blood donors in europe56,57,58. nevertheless, igg seroprevalence among hiv-positive patients and blood donors was similar, and we have not confirmed the presence of babesia dna in tested blood samples (data not published). human babesiosis appears to be rare in europe9, including poland11, which is consistent with a low i. ricinus infection rate (1.6–2.8% in poland, 0.5% in slovakia, 0.7% in switzerland)4,59,60,61.human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are acute febrile tick-borne diseases caused by various species from the genera ehrlichia and anaplasma. a. phagocytophilum, causing human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (hga), and ehrlichia chaffeensis, the etiologic agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (hme), are considered as an emerging zoonosis with clinical manifestations ranging from a mild febrile illness to a fulminant disease characterized by multi-organ system failure, especially in immunocompromised individuals62. hme and hga have similar clinical presentations and both pathogens could be transmitted by transfusion or organ transplantation63,64. till now, only one case of asymptomatic a. phagocytopilum infection in hiv-positive patient was confirmed40. in our study, hiv-infected patients and blood donors presented a similar rate of a. phagocytophilum seroprevalence (<3%). in europe, among blood donors, antibodies to a. phagocytophilum vary from 5% in belgium65 to 22% in greece66. the low a. phagocytophilum seroprevalence rate found in our study is compatible with the small number of clinical cases identified so far67 as well as the low prevalence in i. ricinus ticks in poland5.in persons infected with hiv, ehrlichiosis caused by e. chaffeensis is often life-threatening68. however, the disease responds well to specific, antibiotic therapy, particularly when antibiotics are used at an early stage of infection69. the e. chaffensis seroprevalence in hiv-infected patients in the us was estimated at 1.7% and was similar to the one observed in healthy persons70. nonetheless, in this group of patients the fatal false-negative results of serological test were reported. accordingly, the incidence of ehrlichiosis in this population seems to be underestimated68,69. the severe pathology and multi-organ involvement in fatal ehrlichiosis that mimics toxic shock-like syndrome was observed in patients who are immunocompromised due to other infections, such as hiv or chemotherapy, and is thought to be related to dysregulation of the host immune response and immunopathologic mechanism that leads to tissue damage and multi-system organ failure71,72. in our study, the rate of igg anti-ehrlichia antibodies was almost three times higher in hiv-infected individuals than among blood donors. although our positive patients have not declared clinical manifestation characteristic of tick-borne diseases, the diagnosis of hme in hiv-positive patients is complicated since the symptoms of hme often mimic typical findings commonly associated with hiv-infection70. although in europe the incidences of hge are rather rare and the number of study about e. chaffensis infection in i. ricinus is limited, in hiv-positive patients ehrlichiosis should be considered as potential opportunistic infection.bacteria of bartonella genus are distributed in diversified geographic areas and are transmitted by different arthropod vectors, such as sandflies, the human body louse, the cat flies and probably ticks. contact with animals and vectors seems to be the most important mode of transmission – although the ability of bartonella to survive in stored blood with the potential for transfusion-associated infection has been shown73. bartonella infection presents varied clinical symptoms, mainly in hiv-infected patients whose bacillary anigiomatosis and hepatic peliosis are classically associated with aids74. bartonellosis in this group of patients seems to be less frequent today, possibly because of earlier recognition of hiv serostatus and the lesser number of individuals with cd4 lymphocyte cell counts below 50 cells/mm3 75. our study demonstrated low b. henselae seroprevalence rate among hiv-infected patients and it was similar to that observed in a healthy population of blood donors (<4.5%). bartonella seroreactivity rates varied between 2% and 30% in studies from europe and the us with higher prevalence rates in intravenous drug users, homeless people, cat owners and veterinarians76,77. among hiv-infected patients from europe, anti-bartonella antibodies were significantly higher than in our study and varied from 16% to 41% of individuals78,79. the likelihood of false-negative serological results are high in heavy immunocompromised patients with active bartonella infection80. however, the majority of patients tested in our study have good immunological status – in 81% of tested patients, the level of lymphocyte cd4+ t cells was higher than 300/µl and most of the patients (82%) were on haart. furthermore, in contrast to the previous study where the prevalence of anti-bartonella antibodies is inversely proportional to the number of cd4 lymphocytes74,81, we have not found significant association between the bartonella serological status and lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients. our study presented only 19% of patients with low cd4 levels, which could significantly alter our results. even though the rate of bartonella infection in ticks in poland is rather low (<2%82), the serological studies have proved that b. henselae and b. quintana are present and widely distributed in poland in such specific risk groups as: alcoholics, veterinarians and cats’ owners76. therefore, the further study determining the bartonella prevalence among hiv-infected individuals, especially those with a fever of unknown origin, is needed.intracellular bacteria of the rickettsiaceae family (spotted fever group (sfg) are responsible for tick-borne rickettsiosis. in humans, the syndrome manifests clinically mainly through rash, fever and ‘tache noire’, i.e. eschar developing at the site of the tick bite83. in hiv-positive patients, only isolated cases of mediterranean spotted fever (msf) have been reported and found to be caused primarily by r. monacensis and r. conorii39. occassionally, msf presentation is mimicked by primary hiv infection84. till now, only few serological studies of rickettsia infections among hiv-infected patients in europe were performed. nogueras et al85. have shown that seroprevalences of r. typhi and r. felis infections do not exceed 7% in this group of patients and were similar to those obtained in healthy subjects from the same region. in our study, the estimated the igg seroprevalence of sfg rickettsia was comparable and did not exceed 2% in both groups. nevertheless, the sfg rickettsia seroprevalence in poland seems to be rather high in occupationally exposed populations (forestry and agricultural workers – 36%)86. moreover, rickettsia infection in ticks is high and varies from 4% to 53% depending on the tick species (i. ricinus vs. d. reticulatus, respectively)5,87,88. it is likely that, similarly to bartonella infection, the serologic response in hiv-infected patients with good immunological status could be comparable to that of a healthy population. therefore, the further study estimating the rickettsia prevalence among hiv-infected individuals, especially with heavy immunosuppression, should be conducted.in our study, no significant association was noted between the serological status of patients and their age, sex or lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level in hiv-positive patients. such medical information about patients was available only for 65% individuals, and it was the primary limitation in our study. however, the previous studies, despite the fact that they possessed all the data, did not find any statistical relations between seropositivities and the assessed variables as well43,79,85,89.very few hiv-infected patients and blood donors were seropositive for two of the six studied pathogens. the single infection and coinfections were significantly more often noted in hiv-infected patients whose immunodeficiency significantly increases the risk of infection caused by pathogens. simultaneous seropositivity for a. phagocytophilum and e. chaffeensis was observed in 59% of all coinfections. it is likely that cross-reactive antigens, shared by ehrlichia and anaplasma that induce cross-reactive antibodies, may affect the high rate of false-positive results in serological tests62. due to this cross-reactivity among ehrlichial species, sera should be tested against both e. chaffeensis and a. phagocytophilium antigens when ascribing a specific etiology. coinfections with b. burgdorferi and b. microti were the second most frequent combination noted only in hiv-infected patients. dunn et al.90 observed that coinfection with b. burgdorferi and b. microti significantly increases b. microti parasitemia in mice and that larval ticks become infected with b. microti in greater numbers when fed on coinfected hosts. a possible explanation is that the host immune response to disseminating spirochetes is not restricted to the skin and may interfere with the splenic immune response, which is critical for the control and clearance of b. microti infection. initial case reports suggested that concurrent lyme disease and babesiosis are associated with severe illness91. accordingly, concurrent babesiosis should be considered for any patient with lyme disease who experiences more severe illness symptoms than expected, especially when the patient does not respond well to recommended antibiotic therapy.in our study, the frequency of doubtful results for anaplasma, ehlichia and bartonella was significantly higher in hiv-infected patients than in blood donors. the results of the previous studies have shown that the serological evaluation of the presence of igg ehrlichia antibodies in patients in a single sample is not sufficient to confirm ehrlichiosis. non-specific reactions, which are more often observed in the group of patients infected with hiv, may result from the dysfunction of an immunological system, and they might be the consequence of the cross-reaction with other pathogens92. in consideration of the above, examination of many samples using concurrent serological and molecular tests might be crucial to confirm infection with the specific grade of pathogen (for example ehrlichia or anaplasma)69,92. similarly, in the case of serological diagnostic of bartonella, in patients infected with hiv, the non-specific or false positive results of serological tests are explained by the cross-reaction with the following pathogens: coxiella burnetti or chlamydia trachomatis93,94.in conclusion , our study confirmed that the seroprevalence of tick-borne infections in hiv-infected patients is higher than that of the healthy population in poland, however no association between serological status of patients and lymphocyte cd4+ t cell level has been observed. the frequency of tick-borne coinfections and doubtful results of serological tests seems to be higher in hiv-positive individuals. although the advent of haart had a considerable impact on the incidence of aids-associated opportunistic infections, the further studies of tick-borne infection in hiv-infected patients, particularly in patients who do not regain immunological function despite well controlled hiv replication on effective haart, should be performed95. in this group of patients, tick-borne pathogens may cause chronic, debilitating opportunistic infection and even death. thus, in clinical care of hiv-positive individuals, detailed history of tick bites in endemic tick areas should be collected via directed anamnesis. the low seroprevalence and negative results of molecular studies of tick-borne pathogens in blood donors (data not published) have suggested that the possibility of tick-borne diseases transmission with blood is rather negligible, which is consistent with the lack of reported cases of transfusion-transmitted tick-borne infections in poland. nevertheless, there is still a clear need to further such studies in order to maintain a balance between consideration of the real risk of disease transmission with blood and excessively restrictive approach that eliminates blood donors.methodsselection and recruitment of patients/participants and serum samplesin 2016, serum samples were collected from 199 blood donors (representing the control group) who were diagnosed in amerlab ltd. diagnostic laboratory of parasitic diseases and zoonotic infections. subjects with immunodeficiency were excluded. all participants signed informed consent and obtained a standardized, anonymous questionnaire to record data including age, gender, immunological status, place of residence, the history of tick bite, as well as previously diagnosed borreliosis or other tick-borne diseases. blood samples obtained from blood donors were stored at room temperature and centrifuged immediately or within a maximum of 12 h after collection. sera were frozen at −20 °c until further analysis.the retrospective study was conducted on hiv-positive patients who did not have any known history of tick bite, nor any clinical manifestation characteristic for tick-borne diseases. in 2013, serum samples were collected from 227 patients routinely followed at the hiv outpatients’ clinic of the hospital for infectious diseases in warsaw.the study protocol

Magnetically guided non-invasive CRISPR-Cas9/gRNA delivery across blood-brain barrier to eradicate latent HIV-1 infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40222-4,Research,8 March 2019,yes,"crispr-cas9/grna exhibits therapeutic efficacy against latent human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) genome but the delivery of this therapeutic cargo to the brain remains as a challenge. in this research, for the first time, we demonstrated magnetically guided non-invasive delivery of a nano-formulation (nf), composed of cas9/grna bound with magneto-electric nanoparticles (menps), across the blood-brain barrier (bbb) to inhibit latent hiv-1 infection in microglial (hμglia)/hiv (hc69) cells. an optimized ac-magnetic field of 60 oe was applied on nf to release cas9/grna from menps surface and to facilitate nf cell uptake resulting in intracellular release and inhibition of hiv. the outcomes suggested that developed nf reduced hiv-ltr expression significantly in comparison to unbound cas9/grna in hiv latent hμglia/hiv (hc69) cells. these findings were also validated qualitatively using fluorescence microscopy to assess nf efficacy against latent hiv in the microglia cells. we believe that cns delivery of nf (crispr/cas9-grna-menps) across the bbb certainly will have clinical utility as future personalized nanomedicine to manage neurohiv/aids.
introduction in spite of significant advancements in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart), the elimination of hiv-1 reservoirs from the periphery and central nervous systems (cns) remains a formidable task1,2,3,4,5,6,7. hiv-1 undergoes perpetual integration in the host genome, leading to formation of viral reservoirs and also presents a continuous risk of viral reactivation despite the administration of antiretroviral therapy6,7. further, the inability of antiretroviral therapy (art) to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (bbb) after systemic administration makes brain as one of the most dominant hiv reservoirs8,9. unfortunately, no effective therapeutics are developed yet to cure neurohiv. recent advancements in nanomedicine have shown potential to eradicate hiv via in-vitro and in-vivo model studies10,11,12. however, this nanomedicine approach, based on developing a nano-formulation (nf) containing an encapsulating biomaterials and multi-component therapeutic agents such as hiv latency breaking agent along with drug to combat against hiv, is tested only at peripheral levels. beside this, there is a complexity in efficacy and navigation of drugs to cns due to the strong integrity and semi permeable nature the bbb13,14,15. to address this problem, least component based nfs consisting of a nanocarrier (ncs) and specific therapeutic agent may play a promising role, which can navigate the drug to the cns for hiv-1 recognition and eradication, thus this becomes an urgent requirement to be explored8,16.recent introduction  of genome editing technology known as clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)-associated 9, abbreviated as cas9, targets integrated hiv-1 within the host genome4,5,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. like dna viruses, hiv can also be targeted by crispr/cas9 manipulation as it has a dna intermediate in its life cycle. the crispr/cas9 system has two main components: cas9 (endonuclease) and grna which has a 20 bp guide sequence and directs degradation of specific nucleic acids by navigating the grna/cas9 complex to its target by complementary base pairing. target dna sequence recognition by cas9/grna requires protospacer adjacent motif (pam) trinucleotide sequence, which enables targeting and successive endonuclease disruption. cas9/grna together bind to the target dna sequence, and cas9 makes a double stranded break (dsb) upstream pam. these breaks are then repaired by nhej (non-homologous end joining) dna repair mechanism, which is error prone and results in insertions or deletions (indels) leading to frameshifts or stop codons resulting in disrupted open reading frames (orfs). recently, crispr/cas9 is being used to target and eliminate the hiv in latently infected cd4+ t lymphocytic cells, macrophages, and microglia in cell culture, without causing genotoxicity or off-targeting, confirmed by whole-genome sequencing and surveyor assays17,18. yarn like dna nanoparticles known as dna nanoclews are the recently discovered vehicle synthesized via rolling circle amplification, and reported as a nanocarrier (ncs) to deliver cas9/grna to the target24. nanoparticle assisted delivery of crispr to the brain has recently been demonstrated in mice using intracranial administration to manage fragile x syndrome from exaggerated repetitive behavior25. unfortunately, the non-invasive delivery of cas9/grna across the bbb is not fully explored yet. site-specific delivery of cas9/grna is extremely promising against retroviruses and more studies in context to hiv are urgently required. therefore, an effective strategy for controlled delivery of nfs containing cas9/grna across the bbb to activate and eradicate the latent hiv reservoir in the brain is worth exploring.the one-long-terminal-repeat (1-ltr) circle, the 2-ltr circle, and linear dna are 3 forms where non-integrated dna of hiv exists. in hiv-1, trans-activator of transcription (tat) activates viral transcription by stimulating elongation from ltr. therefore, ltr will be a target gene for the eradication of latent hiv infection from the body. in this manuscript, we demonstrate a magnetically guided non-invasive delivery and on-demand controlled release of cas9/grna targeting hiv-1 ltr across the bbb using magneto-electric nanoparticles (menps) as a drug ncs. the menps are ferromagnetic, non-toxic (up to 50 µg), 25 ± 5 nm in size and able to across the bbb under a static magnetic field. the menps also exhibited a feature of on-demand release of drug upon external ac-magnetic field stimulation which causes polarization changes on menps surface leading to the desired breakdown of bonds between particle and drug. a magnetic nf consisting of cas9/grna bound with menps was developed for non-invasive delivery across the bbb under a static magnetic field of 0.8 t. further, the on-demand release of cas9/grna was achieved on applying ac-magnetic field stimulation via customized electromagnetic coil. the obtained reduced viral ltr expression levels in the cas9/grna treated latent hiv infected hμglia/hiv cells26 confirms the successful delivery of nf across the bbb for targeting of latent virus. such developed therapeutic nf i.e., menps-cas9/grna can be used as a potential therapy to target and eradicate latently hiv-1 infection in the brain.resultsnf (menps-cas9/grna) preparationthe menps utilized in this research as a cas9/grna carriers are well characterized using a vibrating-sample magnetometer (vsm) for magnetization assessment, transmission electron microscopy (tem) for particles size estimation, x-ray diffraction (xrd) pattern for phase purity evaluation. the outcomes of these studies have been described in our previous manuscript16,27. in brief, menps [batio3 (bto) @cofe2o4 (cfo)] of particle size ranging from 20 to 30 nm (fig. 1aa) exhibited diffraction peaks associated with crystallographic planes of cfo (jcpds 00-022-1086) and bto (jcpds 04-001-7269) confirming the phase purity and crystalline characteristics of menps composed of bto and cfo phases16,27. this arrangement of magnetic core and piezoelectric shell showed a ferromagnetic magnetism (34 emu/g), a desired property of an electro-active material to achieve on-demand release of a drug from the menps surface system through an externally applied ac-magnetic field stimulation27.figure 1(a) schematic presentation of nf preparation. surface charged menps of size 25 ± 5 nm bind (as demonstrated by representative tem image) with cas9/grna via electrostatic binding due to differences in surface charge (a). on applying ac-magnetic field stimulation via electromagnetic coil (60 oe for 30 minutes), the change in polarization on menps causes menps-cas9/grna bond length contraction and expansion. this rapid phenomena occurred repeatedly and at some points, the bond between menps and cas9/grna broke down. (b) cas9/grna and binding and release profile. (a) calibration curve plotted between cas9/grna absorption at 260 nm as a function of cas9/grna concentrations. this calibration curve was used to estimate unknown concentration of cas9/grna. cas9/grna % binding with menps (50 µg) as a function of time is shown in inset (a). (b) on-demand release of cas9/grna from menps surface as a function of externally applied ac-magnetic field and time at constant frequency (1 khz).full size imagethe menps are monodispersed (pdi value of 0.24) positively surface charged (zeta potential −30 mv) nanoparticles and can easily bind with negatively charged cas9/grna system via electrostatic interaction. this low value of pdi reveals mono-dispersive characteristics of menps useful for good binding with water soluble drugs like cas9/grna and systemic administration in targeted animal model16. the strategy of menps-cas9/grna nf preparation and cas9/grna release on ac-magnetic field stimulation is illustrated in fig. 1a and described with scientific reasoning in respective sections. time kinetics of cas9/grna binding with menps and further release profile of cas9/grna from nf as a function of ac-magnetic field stimulation were studied using optical density (od) method (fig. 1b). the bound cas9/grna concentration was estimated via measuring od (at 260 nm) of unbound fraction of plasmid (supernatant). based on findings of od study, a calibration curve was established as a function of absorption intensity at 260 nm and cas9/grna concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 µg (fig. 1ba). this linear (r2 = 0.989) calibration curve was used to estimate % binding of cas9/grna over the time and % release of cas9/grna as a function of applied magnetic field. the results of od density showed that 60% of 10 µg cas9/grna binds with 50 µg of menps within 30 minutes of incubation time (inset, fig. 1ba). since, only 60% cas9/grna bind with menps, we selected only 6 µg of cas9/grna to prepare nf to conduct further experiments.the nf i.e. menps-cas9/grna was exposed to an ac-magnetic field generated from an indigenously customized electromagnetic coils. externally applied ac-magnetic fields stimulation (40 and 60 oe at 100 khz) exposed to nf alter polarization in menps and cause expansion and contraction in ionic bonds available on menps surface. this phenomena occurs repeatedly and break electrostatic bonding and releases cas9/grna system from menps surface. after applying ac-magnetic field, the mixture was centrifuged to conduct od study for the estimation of % release cas9/grna system. the results of od suggested that the release of cas9/grna system is a function of applied field and stimulation time. at a constant exposure time for 30 minutes, applied filed of 40 oe field exhibited 70% release of cas9/grna, while approximately 98% cas9/grna release was obtained on applying magnetic field of 60 oe (fig. 1bb). these findings suggest that a magnetic field of 60 oe applied for 30 minutes would be enough to release maximum % of plasmid in in-vitro bbb models also.characterization menps-cas9/grna formulationthe qualitative assessment of the possible formation and deformation of binding during preparation of menps-cas9/grna nf and on-demand release of cas9/grna from nf were evaluated using raman spectroscopy (fig. 2). nucleic acids exhibits strong raman bands in mid-frequency region (600 to 1800 cm−1) corresponds to intramolecular modes of nucleic acid bases such as adenosine (a), guanine (g), cytosine (c), thymidine (t), d-deoxyribose of sugar phosphate scaffold. we also selected this region to evaluate nf preparation and release of cas9/grna. the raman spectra of cas9/grna (curve a) exhibited all optically active modes corresponds to the bases alone and in combination i.e., a, g, c, & t [570 cm-1 (c;g), 621 cm−1 (a;c;t), 630 cm−1 (a), 760 cm−1 (t;d), 780 cm−1 (c), 1150 cm−1 (t;c), 1380 cm−1 (t;a;g), 1505 cm−1 (a;g), and 1580 cm−1 (a ring stretching, n6h2 deformation)]28,29 present in nucleic acid chain, dna backbone (800 to 1000 cm−1)30, and optically active modes related with d at 900 to 1000 cm−1 (sharp bands of higher intensity), d (c=o) at 1050 cm−1 and d (ch2) at 1500 cm−1 as shown in curve a. on comparative raman analysis of nf (curve b), we observed that nf consisting menps-cas9/grna exhibited all possible band of modes related with cas9/grna (curve a) and menps (curve c). the peak position of raman modes in nf exhibits a small shift due to ionic bond formation between menps and cas9/grna via electrostatic interaction.figure 2qualitative confirmation of nf preparation and the release of cas9/grna using raman spectroscopy. raman spectra of cas9/grna (curve a), menps-cas9/grna nf (curve b), menps (curve c) nf after external ac-magnetic field stimulation (curve d).full size imagethe menps exhibited raman active modes (curve c) associated with bto31 and cfo32 to confirm the presence of menps i.e., bto@cfo. raman mode at 500 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 are attributed to tetragonal phase of bto and cubical inverse-spinel structure, respectively. raman observed below 300 cm−1 is attributed to e (transversal (to) and longitudinal (lo) components to + lo) mixed mode. raman band at 515 cm−1 corresponds to transversal modes i.e., e (to) and a1 (to) of bto31. further raman peak around 800 cm−1 corresponds to stacking-fault density of bto phase, and appears due to high temperature calcination of menps at 780 °c. the cubic spinal active raman modes, mainly due to eg, and three of f2g symmetries were observed at 300 cm−1. the peak observed at 670 cm−1 is attributed to the f2g symmetry of cfo which is a characteristic co-o displacement.the nf was stimulated through ac-magnetic field and as explained above, it detached cas9/grna from menps surface. raman spectra of nf after ac-magnetic field stimulation was measured (curve d) to prove the release of cas9/grna through breaking of ionic bonds on ac-magnetic field stimulation. it was observed that raman modes associated with cas9/grna disappeared, which confirm the release of cas/grna. though 100% drug release in general is not possible, this is the reason that some bands of low intensities are still visible in curve. however, the raman modes observed in nf after ac-magnetic field stimulation seem corresponds to menps only. this confirmed the release of cas9/grna from nf due to breakdown of bonding through ac-magnetic field stimulation via electromagnetic coil.toxicity assessment of menps and nfs (menps-cas9/grna)the in-vitro cytotoxicity of menps (10–100 µg), cas9/grna (6 µg) and nf [menps (50 µg)-cas9/grna (6 µg)] was assessed by performing xtt assay (fig. 3). cells associated with in-vitro bbb model; human astrocytes (ha), human pericytes (hp), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmec), and chme5 cell lines upon treatment with menps concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 µg exhibited approximately 90% cell viability compared to control (fig. 3a). however, cell viability reduced to 70% upon treatment with high dose of menps (100 µg). therefore 50 µg of menps was found to be an optimized dose for preparing a nf using cas9/grna system (6 µg). the menp concentrations we have used in this cytotoxicity experiment are very high considering the number of cells we have used, the surface area and amount of the media. we have chosen to use these broad ranges of menp concentrations to determine the biosafety of our nanoformulations even at high concentrations. we have observed no cytotoxicity up to 50 µg of menp which indicate the biosafety of our nanoparticles even at high concentrations.figure 3cytotoxicity study of menps and nf with respect to cns cell tyoes (ha, hp, hbmecs, and chem-5). (a) xtt assay of menps concertation ranging from 10 to 1000 µg, (b) xtt assay of menps (50 µg), cas9/grna (6 µg), and nf [menps (50 µg)-cas9/grna (6 µg)] to assess cns cells viability. (*p ≤ 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001; ns-not significant).full size imagethe xtt assay performed on cns cells (ha, hp, hbmec, chme5) treated with menps (50 µg), cas9/grna (6 µg) and nf (menps-cas9/grna formulation) (fig. 3b) showed cell viability of around 90% which indicates no toxic effects during the treatments. this implies that our prepared menps-cas9/grna nf is safe for cells in-vitro and can be explored for further use in-vivo systems.evaluation of in-vitro bbb integrity and nf transmigration across the bbbvarious parameters such as nanoparticle at interface of cells, hiv infection, and magnetic field stimulation may affect the tight junction of bbb and facilitate the transmigration of unwanted element to the brain. thus exploring bbb junction integrity becomes crucial in this study. an in-vitro bbb model was placed on a static magnet (0.8 t) for 3 hours to facilitate navigation of nf across the bbb as illustrated in fig. 4a. the upper chambers of the both normal (fig. 4a) and hiv infected (fig. 4b) bbb models, were treated with menps (50 µg), cas9/grna (6 µg) and nf. the integrity of bbb model was evaluated via measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) values and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) intensity of control and each treated wells. the findings from teer values and fitc experiments explained that each treatments does not affect bbb integration in the both models.figure 4effect of menps (50 µg), cas9/grna (6 µg), and nf [menps (50 µg)-cas9/grna (6 µg)] on bbb integrity (a) and hiv infected (b) in-vitro model. magnetically guided navigation of menps-cas9/grna nfs. an optimized dose of nf consist of menps (50 µg) and cas9/grna (6 µg) was spread on top section of bbb for navigation across bbb under a static magnetic field (0.8 t for 3 hrs). (ns-not significant).full size imageammonium thiocyanate-based photometric assay (490 nm) was performed to estimate concentration of menps which was able to cross the bbb. the assay results suggested that 26% menps crossed the bbb in-vitro. upon estimation of od, from media collected from the lower chamber of the bbb model after ac-magnetic field stimulation, we observed that that 2 µg cas9/grna was released in the lower chamber subsequent to the bbb transmigration.on-demand release and functionality evaluation of cas9/grna systemto release cas9/grna from nf, hiv-infected bbb model was placed in an electromagnetic coil for ac-magnetic stimulation, as illustrated in fig. 5a. an optimized ac-magnetic field of 60 oe was applied for 30 minutes to achieve cas9/grna release in the lower chamber of the bbb model. to compare the functionality of released cas9/grna, an identical experiment was performed wherein, the bbb was treated using only cas9/grna. the media from lower chamber of treated bbb model (with hiv alone, cas9/grna-hiv, and nf-hiv) was collected and amount of released cas9/grna was estimated, by deciphering it ability to reduce hiv long terminal repeat (ltr) expression level (fig. 5b) in hc69 cells grown in basal chamber of the in vitro bbb model.figure 5(a) on-demand release of cas9/grna form menps surface and plasmid efficacy assessment. an optimized ac-magnetic field (60 oe for 30 minutes) was applied through an electromagnetic coil to generate enough stimulation to break the bond between cas9/grna and menp. (b) bio-functional activity of released cas9/grna will eradicate latently infected hiv reservoirs at cellular level, and (c) an illustration of nf up taken by mg cells via nano-electro-poration. (*p ≤ 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001; ns-not significant).full size imagethe ltr level in hiv infected sample was estimated as 65, compared to uninfected control. in case of only cas9/grna treated the bbb, the treatment reduced ltr level to 48 confirming that cas9/grna remains functional and does not lose its activity on applying ac-magnetic field. the ltr expression levels reduced remarkably to 40 on treatment with released cas9/grna from nf on ac-magnetic field stimulation. this significant reduction in ltr expression, compared to hiv infected cells, may be attributed to intracellular eradicating mechanism due to significantly high cell uptake.this is due to easy and high cell uptake of nf via electroporation on applying ac-magnetic field. electroporation in cells on applying ac-magnetic field of 60 oe has been demonstrated in our previous publication12. in brief, cfo core of menps went through a strain change on applying ac-magnetic field stimulation. this deformation was further absorbed by bto piezoelectric shell of menps to cause pressure waves. this generated pressure wave is capable to misaligned phospholipid later of cell member to cause poration when menps is at µm distance from the cell. this ac-magnetic field induced nano-electro-poration caused nf delivery inside the cell resulted in higher efficacy.due to electroporation, there is a high uptake of nf by h-mg cells followed up by intracellular release of cas9/grna on stimulation, as schematically illustrated in fig. 5c. this phenomena cause hiv-infection eradication intracellularly resulting in more reduction in hiv-ltr expression level than using pure cas9/grna. in the quantitative analysis of the efficacy of cas9/grna and its menp based nf using florescent microscopy (fig. 6a), we have observed significantly reduced gfp fluorescence in cas9/grna treated cells when compared to the untreated control cells indicating significantly reduced latent infection in hiv-gfp cells. furthermore, using menp based nf of cas9/grna, we have observed further reduction of latent infection when compared to the cas9/grna alone treatment. intensity of the florescence is directly proportional to the hiv-1 ltr levels which is an indicative of hiv infection levels in those cells. quantitative assessment of fluorescent intensity analysis of images indicates that nf is more efficient in reducing the latent infection levels when compared to the cas9/grna alone (fig. 6b).figure 6immunofluorescence analysis of hc69.5 cells on treatment of ltr-b plasmid b and nf. clone hc69.5 (hiv/gfp) were treated with ltr-b plasmid, and menp/ltr-b plasmids nf. cells were cultured under 1% of fbs and incubated for 2 hrs after treatment. after the release procedure, cells were fixed using pfa 4% and visualized using keyence all in one microscope (10x). (**p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001; ns-not significant).full size imagediscussion we propose positively surface charged mono-dispersed ferromagnetic menps as potential ncs to navigate cas9/grna across the bbb under the influence of static magnetic field, which is safe and non-invasive. additionally, we demonstrated an on-demand release of cas9/grna from nf on applying ac-magnetic field externally through electromagnetic coil. the cas9/grna binds to menps via electrostatic binding due to opposite surface charges, as demonstrated by raman analysis. the results of od studies values demonstrated that within 30 minutes of incubation time, 60% cas9/grna of 10 µg with 50 µg of menps and ~98% cas9/grna released on applying 60 oe ac-magnetic field. the cytotoxicity studies and teer value measurement studies confirmed that menps (50 µg), cas9/grna system (6 µg) and nf do not adversely affect cell viability and also the bbb integrity on each respective treatment. our developed nf has the ability to cross the bbb, in-vitro model, under the influence of a static magnetic field due to the magnetic nature of nf. thus demonstrated magnetically guided non-invasive bbb transmigration technique may be effective and practicable over the conventional techniques such as focused ultrasound methods, electric field, photosensitization etc. these methods are not well adopted due to transient bbb opening which can allow entrance of other foreign moieties8,33 which induce cell damage and slow recovery. we estimated that 26% menps navigated across the bbb which is significant in comparison of tat-mediated34 and liposome35 encapsulated delivery of organic and inorganic nanostructures for drug delivery application. development of an efficient nf which can be guided externally across the bbb without any side effects becomes extremely important. thus our proposed delivery method seems to be one of the potential solution to overcome challenges8.cas9/grna was released across the bbb, in controlled manner via applying an optimized ac-magnetic field of 60 oe for 30 min. the released cas9/grna was biologically active and reduced hiv-ltr expression levels in latent hiv-1 infected cells. the results of presented studies showed that the cas9/grna released form nf exhibit superior therapeutic efficacy in comparison of treatment using cas9/grna only. this is attributed to higher uptake of nf due to electroporation and its ability to target latent hiv-1 genome suggesting as a promising therapeutic approach. our investigated on-demand and controlled intracellular hiv-1 infection eradication approach using nanotechnology is unique and has never been demonstrated before. the other available approaches are multicomponent therapeutics to activate latent virus and further to eradicate hiv infection. the integration of all these agents results in a large size (>150) which exhibit poor efficacy because of size constraints due to intact integrity of the bbb36,37. the development of effective therapeutic nfs based on minimal sized therapeutic agent system which can cross the bbb and activate and eradicate hiv in brain reservoirs are urgently required. we demonstrate that designed cas9/grna recognize and eliminate hiv-1 infection, confirmed by reduction in ltr expression level, in cns cells upon successful delivery across the bbb using nanotechnology with the feature of on-demand release and no noticeable side-effects. this technology is of crucial significance against hiv reservoirs in the brain. earlier studies by dr. khalili’s group recently reported that cas9/grna specifically targeting u3 region of hiv-1 ltr, inactivates viral gene transcription and thereby the viral replication in latently infected cells38. our results suggest that menp guided delivery of cas9/grna across the bbb will have a translational significance in eradicating hiv latency in the brain.in conclusion , we demonstrated non-invasive magnetically guided delivery of cas9/grna across the bbb using menps as a drug nc. high cell-uptake of nf via nano-electroporation and on-demand release of cas9/grna (98%) through ac-magnetic field stimulation resulting in significant hiv-ltr reduction than control cas9/grna. due to salient features such as bio-compatibility, non-invasive cns delivery, and on-demand cas9/grna release our developed nf has potential to manage neurohiv. as a viewpoint, aiming to develop a cas9/grna nanomedicine as therapy for neurohiv, this such developed nf delivery need to be demonstrated in appropriate animal model. authors are in process to optimized/develop an appropriate animal to demonstrate herein proposed technology to eradicate neurohiv. we have previously demonstrated non-invasive and safe delivery of menps to the mice brain and observed uniform distribution of menps in all brain cell types without agglomeration and without altering motor coordination function of mice16. as future direction, in combination with our established magnetically guided delivery to the brain technology, cas9/grna can successfully be delivered to the brain for the eradication of neurohiv/aids.online methodscas9/grna selectiona complete procedure, bio-informatics screening, genetic sequences, functionality and capability to reduce hiv-ltr of crispr designed cas9/grna employed in this work has been discussed by khalili et al.38. bio-informatics screening and efficiency/off target prediction identified four grna targets within the hiv-1 ltr, named a, b, c and d that avoid conserved transcription factor binding sites, minimizing the likelihood of altering host gene expression. expression of these grnas by a vector that also expresses the cas9 protein in the chme5 cells, a microglial cell line that harbors integrated copies of a single round hiv-1 reporter (pnl4-3-δgag-d2egfp), drastically suppressed ltr promoter-driven expression as measured by the fraction of egfp positive cells, reported in previous publication38. the grna specific to ltr-b in chme-5 cells exhibited maximum reduction in ltr promoter-driven expression shown by p24 and ltr fold change. we have used cas9/grna specific to ltr-b for navigation across the bbb using menps as ncs non-invasively. dr. khalili’s group has reported at the multiplex expression of ltr a/b grnas in chme5 cells caused deletion of 190 bp fragment between the a & b target sites and led to junction site mutations to various degrees as detected by pcr and sanger sequencing38. this treatment completely suppressed the appearance of egfp positive cells, due to inhibition of ltr transcription in the cells. this group has estimated viral load using p24 elisa and real time pcr analysis. the results of these studies showed a substantial decrease in viral replication. the low, but detectable, residual viral presence is almost certainly due to the background of transfected cells.synthesis of menpsthe menps of batio3@cofe2o4, composed of two precursors namely cofe2o4 (cfo) and batio3 (bto) are synthesized using our established three steps method11,12. the synthesize cfo nanoparticles 15 ml of aqueous mixture of 0.058 g of co(no3)2.6h2o, 0.16 g of fe(no3)3.9h2o and 0.2 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (av. mol. wt. −40,000) is dissolved in 5 ml of aqueous 0.9 g of sodium borohydride at 120 °c for 12 h. the bto precursor solution was prepared by mixing two solutions a) 0.029 g of baco3, 0.1 g of citric acid with 30 ml of ethanol solution and b) 0.048 ml titanium isopropoxide and 1 g of citric acid are mixed to prepare batio3 precursor solution. finally, menps were prepared by dispersing 0.1 g of cofe2o4 nanoparticles in the bto precursor solution under sonication for 2 h, further dried at 60 °c for overnight, and followed by calcination at 780 °c for 5 h. synthesized menps were characterized fei cm 200 transmission electron microscope (tem), x-ray diffractometer (xrd, based on mo-kα radiation) to evaluate morphology, particle size, and crystalline nature. energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds) and vibrational sample magnetometer (vsm) studies were also conducted to evaluate chemical composition and magnetic behavior of menps.fabrication and characterization of menps-cas9/grna nfto prepare a nf, 10 µg of cas9/grna was dispersed in 100 µl (pbs) containing 50 µg of menps in an eppendorf on rotating platform. after 30 minutes, mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 minute. the supernatant containing menps bound cas9/grna was collected and washed with pbs (ph 7.4) to remove unbound cas9/grna. the upper part of solution contains only unbound cas9/grna which was further quantified to know the amount of bound plasmid with reference to control. to determine time kinetics, a calibration curve of cag9/grna was established as a function of known concentration and absorption intensity at 280 nm. thus established calibration curve was used to estimate bound or percentage binding of cas9/grna with menps. to explore time kinetics, percentage binding of cas9/grna (10 µg) with menps (50 µg) was studied as a function of time (10 to 30 minutes). the stepwise preparation of menps-cas9/grna nf was characterized using raman spectroscopy (nomadic raman microscope with bayspec 532 nm laser) to confirm possible bindings between precursors. 20 µl of cas9/grna (10 µg), menps (50 µg), and menps-cas9/grna (50 µg:10 µg) solution in di water was drop-casted on silica substrate to perform raman spectroscopy.measurement of cytotoxicitythe xtt assay was performed to evaluate toxicity of menps (10 to 100 µg), cas9/grna (1 to 10 µg) and menps-cas9/grna (50 µg: 6 µg) nf in cns cell lines used in in-vitro bbb model (human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmec, cat# 1000; sciencell); human astrocytes (ha, cat# 1800; sciencell); human brain vascular pericytes (hp, cat# 1200; sciencell) and microglia cells (chme-5, obtained from dr. jose rodriguez, universidad central del caribe, puerto rico)). the cns cell types were assayed for cell proliferation and viability by xtt assay (cat #30-1011 k; atcc) after 4 hours and 24 hours of treatment, in order to investigate the cytotoxicity of the different concentration of menps. populations of 1 × 104 cells were seeded in 96 well plate and cells were treated with different concentration of menps, cas9/grna and nf. the xtt assay was measured at 475 nm and 660 nm using biotek synergy ht multimode microplate reader instrument. the results were expressed as percentage of cell viability compared to control cells.preparation of in-vitro bbb model and navigation of nf across the bbban established procedure as described earlier was used to prepare a bbb model39. the model consisted of two-compartment wells in a culture plate, with the upper compartment separated from the lower by a cyclopore polyethylene terephthalate membrane (collaborative biochemical products, becton dickinson, san jose, ca) with a pore diameter of 3 μm. in a 24 well cell culture insert, 2 × 105 primary hbmecs were grown to confluency on the upper side whereas a confluent layer of primary ha and hp (1 × 105 cells/insert) were grown on the underside. a 0.5 × 105 chme-5 cells population was added to the 24 well plate surfaces. intactness of the bbb was determined by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (teer) using millicell ers microelectrodes (millipore, billerica, ma). to prepare a hiv infected the bbb model, chme-5 hiv infected cells (5dpi) were added to the lower surface of the 24 well plate after checking the intactness of the bbb. the bbb model was used for experiments at least 5 days after cell seeding.the upper chamber of such constructed bbb was treated with 100 µl of menps (50 µg), cas9/grna (10 µg), and menps-cas9/grna (50 µg: 6 µg) nf. bbb containing 24 well plate was placed on top of a static magnet (0.8 t) for 3 hour. the applied static magnetic field facilitates transmigration of menps containing nf across the bbb10. teer measurements were performed after 3 hrs and 24 hrs of treatments. the electrical resistance of blank inserts with medium alone was subtracted from teer readings obtained from inserts with confluent monolayers. the resulting teer values represent the resistance of the endothelial cell monolayers. the results are presented as percent of control. in parallel, the effects of the treatment on the paracellular transport of flourescein isothiocyanate–labeled (fitc) dextran (molecular weight 40000) were measured according to the procedure described earlier40,41. fitc-dextran (sigma aldrich) of 100 mg/ml was added to the upper chamber of the inserts and further incubated for 4 h. samples were collected from the bottom chamber after 4 h and fluorescence intensity was measured using a excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm using biotek synergy ht multimode microplate reader instrument. fitc-dextran transport was expressed as fluorescence units of fitc-dextran transported across the bbb into the lower compartment. all data are presented as the mean ± the standard deviation of the mean (s.d). the results were analyzed using anova (kruskal-wallis test) followed by dunn’s multiple comparison post- test to determine statistical significance (graph pad 5 software, inc., la jolla, ca, usa).the navigation of menps across the bbb to the lower chamber was quantitatively confirmed via estimating fe ion concentration using ammonium thiocyanate-based photometry assay as described in our previous paper10. the qualitative confirmation of menps was also performed using tem imaging of lower chamber media.on-demand release of cas9/grna and functional assessmenta 24 well-plate containing menps-cas9/grna nf navigated across the bbb was placed in an indigenously designed electromagnetic coil (dimension 4 × 6 inches) for field control release of cas9/grna system. the cas9/grna release procedure was performed using ac-magnetic field of 40 and 60 oe at a constant frequency of 1 khz and time of 30 minutes to optimize maximum drug release (around 98%). these h-mg and hiv latent h-mg cells were provided by the research group of dr. jonathan karn, department of molecular biology and microbiology, case western reserve university, cleveland, oh.hc69.5 (hiv/gfp) and hiv-gfp cells were treated with ltr-b plasmid (cas9/grna) and related menps based nf. cells were incubated for 2 hrs followed by applying ac-magnetic field (60 oe for 30 minutes) to release the plasmid. the functionality assessment of release plasmid was performed via ltr expression (quantitative) and immunofluorescence imaging (qualitative) as a function of gfp fluorescence. for ltr expression, cells were cultured under 1% of fbs. the c20 clone, the parenteral cells were used as a negative control. rna was extracted using rneasy mini kit (qiagen) and reverse transcribed (high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit; life technologies) followed by quantitative real time analysis using pcr for ltr gene. for fluorescence microscopic analysis, clone hc69.5 (hiv/gfp) cells treated with ltr-b (cas9/grna) plasmid and related nf was cultured under 1% of fbs and incubated for 2hrs followed by applying release conditions identically. after this procedure, the cells were fixed using pfa 4% to perform fluorescence imaging using a keyence all in one microscope (10x)statistical analysisexperiments conducted in this study were performed at least three times in duplicate and values were expressed as means ± standard deviation (sd). an unpaired student t-test was performed and a p values ≤ 0:05 were regarded as significant. for more than 2 groups, the data were analyzed using graphpad prism software. comparisons between groups were performed using one-way anova and turkey’s multiple comparison post test. differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.

Intron-containing RNA from the HIV-1 provirus activates type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07753-2,Research,13 December 2018,yes,"hiv-1-infected people who take drugs that suppress viremia to undetectable levels are protected from developing aids. nonetheless, hiv-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived cd4+ memory t cells, and perhaps other cell types, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy. here we show that the hiv-1 provirus activates innate immune signaling in isolated dendritic cells, macrophages, and cd4+ t cells. immune activation requires transcription from the hiv-1 provirus and expression of crm1-dependent, rev-dependent, rre-containing, unspliced hiv-1 rna. if rev is provided in trans, all hiv-1 coding sequences are dispensable for activation except those cis-acting sequences required for replication or splicing. our results indicate that the complex, post-transcriptional regulation intrinsic to hiv-1 rna is detected by the innate immune system as a danger signal, and that drugs which disrupt hiv-1 transcription or hiv-1 rna metabolism would add qualitative benefit to current antiviral drug regimens.
introduction there are currently over 40 antiretroviral drug formulations that block essential steps in the hiv-1 replication cycle, including reverse transcription, integration, and proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins1,2. although these treatments are effective at reducing viremia, hiv-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived cd4+ memory t cells, and perhaps other cell types3,4,5, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy6. as a result, hiv-1-infected individuals must maintain a strict regimen of antiviral drugs or risk viral rebound and development of hiv-1 drug resistance6,7,8,9. furthermore, despite the drastic reduction in viral replication, these individuals sometimes exhibit chronic inflammation associated with heightened risk of cardiovascular pathology10,11,12. though the majority of proviruses that persist during antiviral therapy are defective for the production of infectious virions13, many proviruses are expressed, raising the possibility that the hiv-1 provirus, or its transcripts, contribute to ongoing inflammation14.hiv-1 exploits a number of host and viral factors to avoid detection by the innate immune system15. innate immune detection of hiv-1 has been reported to occur via a variety of mechanisms. early after encounter with a target cell, hiv-1 ca interaction with host trim516,17, or, independently, hiv-1 gp4118, activates transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (tak1)-dependent signaling pathways. plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) readily detect hiv-1 rna via tlr7 and produce copious levels of type i interferon19,20,21. hiv-1 genomic rna has also been reported to activate rig-i signaling22,23, and hiv-1 cdna can be detected by the cytoplasmic dna sensor cgas24,25,26. sensing of hiv-1 infection has also been suggested to occur following integration, with critical determinants including hiv-1 capsid27, post-integration cgas signaling25, and abortive hiv-1 rna transcripts28.the determinants for innate immune detection of hiv-1 were investigated in detail here. to start, dendritic cells were challenged with a large panel of single-cycle hiv-1 vectors. the results show that high-level activation of innate immune gene expression in transduced cells requires integration, as well as transcription from the provirus. furthermore, dc maturation is dependent upon rev-crm1-mediated export of intron-bearing, hiv-1 genomic rna. transduced macrophages and cd4+ t cells behave like transduced dcs. primary hiv-1 clones in the context of complete, replication-competent hiv-1 also give similar results. the observations reported here demonstrate that the innate immune system detects hiv-1’s unique modes of rna processing and suggest that inhibitors of hiv-1 transcription or hiv-1 rna metabolism would be beneficial additions to current retroviral therapy.resultsdendritic cells mature in response to challenge with hiv-1to determine if hiv-1 proviruses activate innate immune signaling, human blood cells were transduced with single-cycle vectors, either a full-length, single-cycle hiv-1 clone with a frameshift in env and egfp in place of nef (hiv-1-gfp)29, or a minimal 3-part lentivector encoding gfp (fig. 1a, and supplementary table 1)16. monocyte derived dendritic cells (dcs) were challenged initially since hiv-1 transduction of these specialized antigen-presenting cells activates innate immune signaling23,24,27,30,31. to increase the efficiency of provirus establishment, vectors were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (vsv g) and delivered concurrently with virus-like particles (vlps) bearing sivmac251 vpx (fig. 1b)16,32. transduction efficiency, as determined by flow cytometry for gfp-positive cells, was 30-60% (fig. 1b and supplementary fig 1a), depending on the blood donor.fig. 1hiv-1 transduction matures dcs. a schematic of hiv-1-gfp, with frameshift in env (red line) and gfp in place of nef29, and of the minimal lentivector, with self-inactivating δu3 ltr42 and gfp driven by the sffv promoter16. unless indicated otherwise, vectors were pseudotyped with vsv g and cells were co-transduced with sivmac251 vlps bearing vpx. b flow cytometry of dcs for gfp and cd86, after treatment as indicated. c flow cytometry histograms for the indicated markers 72 h

autologous dcs transduced with the indicated vectors. g dc transduction with hiv-1-gfp in the absence of vpx and the presence of 2 mm nucleosides. h 12-day spreading infection on dcs, with

assessed by luminex, 72 h after transduction with hiv-1-gfp (black) or minimal lentivector (gray). shown are blood donor data representative of n = 12 (b), n = 4 (c–k), or n = 8 (h). to determine significance, the mfi of all live cells for each sample was calculated as fold-change versus control. the exception being h where the mfi of only gfp+ cells was compared. when data from each donor replicate within a experiment was combined, the difference in mfi for all experimental vs control conditions was significant in all cases, p < 0.01; one-way anova, dunnett’s post-test. qrt-pcr and luminex data were mean ± sd, p < 0.0001; two-way anova, dunnett’s post-testfull size imagedcs matured in response to hiv-1-gfp transduction, as indicated by increased mean fluorescence intensity of co-stimulatory or activation molecules, including hla-dr, cd80, cd86, cd40, cd83, ccr7, cd141, isg15, mx1, and ifit133 (fig. 1b, c and supplementary fig. 1a, b). identical results were obtained with full-length, single-cycle vectors generated from primary, transmitted/founder clones that were derived by single genome sequencing, hiv-1ad1734, hiv-1z331m-tf35, and hiv-1zm249m36, the first virus being clade b, the other two clade c (fig. 1d and supplementary fig. 1c). a single cycle hiv-2 vector induced maturation, indicating that this innate response was not unique to hiv-1 (fig. 1e and supplementary fig. 1d).maturation was evident among both gfp positive and negative cells (fig. 1b), the latter likely resulting from activation in trans by type 1 ifn as others have shown27,31. to test this idea, naive dcs were incubated with filtered supernatant from autologous dcs that had been transduced previously with hiv-1-gfp. supernatant from dcs transduced with hiv-1-gfp, but not with minimal lentivector, upregulated cd86 and isg15 on the naive dcs (fig. 1f and supplementary fig 1e). maturation activity was evident at a 1:1000 dilution of supernatant to which nevirapine had been added to preclude carry-over of transduction-competent hiv-1-gfp.dcs matured when hiv-1-gfp transduction efficiency was augmented with nucleosides37, rather than with siv vlps, indicating that vpx was not required for maturation (fig. 1g and supplementary fig. 1f). dcs were then challenged with replication-competent hiv-1 bearing ccr5-tropic env, either t cell-tropic or macrophage-tropic38, with or without vpx-vlps (fig. 1h and supplementary fig. 1g). the percent of cells transduced by vector bearing either env increased with vpx, though dc maturation was observed under all conditions, even among the very few dcs transduced by t cell-tropic env (see inset of fig. 1h). these results indicate that neither vsv g, nor vpx, nor high-titer infection, was required for dc maturation.in response to transduction with hiv-1-gfp, steady-state cxcl10, ifnb1, and il15 mrnas reached maximum levels at 48 h, increasing 31,000-, 92-, and 140-fold relative to mock-treated cells, respectively (fig. 1i, j). correspondingly, ifnα2, ccl7, il-6, cxcl10, and tnfα proteins accumulated in the supernatant (fig. 1k). in contrast to the results with hiv-1-gfp, there were no signs of maturation after transduction with the 3-part minimal lentivector (fig. 1b, j, k and supplementary fig. 1a, b, c, d).dc maturation requires reverse transcription and integrationto determine if early stages in the hiv-1 replication cycle were necessary for maturation, reverse transcription was inhibited by nevirapine (nvp) or the hiv-1 rt mutant d185k/d186l, and integration was inhibited with raltegravir (ralt) or the hiv-1 in mutant d116a (supplementary tables 1 and 2), as previously described39. each of these four conditions abrogated maturation, as indicated by cell surface cd86 (fig. 2a, and supplementary fig. 2a) and steady-state cxcl10 mrna (fig. 2b). when integration was inhibited, cxcl10 mrna increased in response to challenge with hiv-1-gfp, but levels were nearly 1,000 times lower than when integration was not blocked (fig. 2b). as an additional control, dcs challenged with the well-characterized, non-infectious, protease active-site mutant d25a40 expressed 10,000 times less cxcl10 mrna than did cells transduced with hiv-1-gfp (fig. 2b).fig. 2native hiv-1 rna regulation is necessary for dc maturation. a assessment of gfp and cd86 by flow cytometry following transduction

sffv promoter driving expression of tat, rev, or both, and repaired u3 in the 3′ ltr. when an essential viral component was disrupted within hiv-1-gfp, the factor in question was provided in trans, either during assembly in transfected hek293 cells, or within transduced dcs, as appropriate (see methods). shown are blood donor data representative of n = 6 (a, b, e, f), n = 12 (c, g, h), n = 8 (d). to determine significance, the mfi of individual flow cytometry samples was calculated as fold-change versus control. when data from each donor replicate within a experiment were combined, the difference in mfi for all experimental vs control conditions was significant in all cases, p < 0.01; one-way anova, dunnett’s post-test against hiv-1-gfp for a, c, d, h or lentivector control for e,

respectively23,24. signal transduction downstream of both sensors requires tbk1 and irf3. the tbk1 inhibitor bx795 (supplementary table 2) blocked dc maturation in response to cgamp but had no effect on maturation after hiv-1-gfp transduction (fig. 2c and supplementary fig. 2b). moreover, irf3 knockdown (supplementary table 1)16 suppressed activation of cd86 or isg15 in response to cgamp, but not in response to hiv-1 transduction (fig. 2c and supplementary fig. 2b). similarly, no effect on hiv-1-induced dc maturation was observed with knockdown of irf1, 5, 7, or 9, or of stat1 or 2, supplementary table 1)16, or of pharmacologic inhibition of cypa, pkr, c-raf, ikba, nf-kb, mek1 + 2, p38, jnk, caspase 1, pan-caspases, ask1, eif2a, tbk1, ikke, tak1, or nlrp3 (supplementary table 2). under the conditions used here, then, dc maturation required reverse transcription and integration but was independent of most well characterized innate immune signaling pathways.provirus transcription is required for innate activationcompletion of the hiv-1 integration reaction requires cellular dna repair enzymes41. that dcs did not mature in response to transduction with minimal lentivectors (fig. 1b, j, k) indicates that activation of the dna repair process is not sufficient, and that transcription from the hiv-1-gfp provirus must be necessary for maturation. indeed, gag expression from an integrated vector has been reported to be necessary for dc maturation27. to determine if any individual hiv-1 proteins were sufficient to mature dcs, a minimal lentivector was used to express codon optimized versions of each of the open reading frames possessed by hiv-1-gfp (fig. 2d, supplementary fig. 2b, and supplementary table 1). among these vectors was a gag-expression vector that produced as much p24 protein as did hiv-1-gfp (fig. 2d). none of these vectors matured dcs (fig. 2d and supplementary fig. 2d).hiv-1-gfp was then mutated to determine if any protein coding sequences were necessary for dc maturation. for these and any subsequent experiments in which an essential viral component was disrupted within hiv-1-gfp, the factor in question was provided in trans, either during assembly in transfected hek293 cells, or within transduced dcs, as appropriate (see methods). mutations that disrupted both gag and pol, either a double frameshift in gag, or a mutant in which the first 14 atgs in gag were mutated, abolished synthesis of ca (p24) yet retained full maturation activity (fig. 2e, supplementary fig. 2e, and supplementary table 1). deletion mutations encompassing gag/pol, vif/vpr, vpu/env, or nef/u3-ltr, each designed so as to leave cis-acting rna elements intact, all matured dcs (fig. 2f, supplementary fig. 2e, and supplementary table 1). these results indicate that these hiv-1-gfp rna sequences, as well as the proteins that they encode, were not required for dc maturation.tat and rev coding sequences were individually disrupted by combining start codon point mutations with nonsense codons that were silent with respect to overlapping reading frames (supplementary table 1). neither δtat nor δrev matured dcs upon transduction (fig. 2g and supplementary fig. 2f). however, dcs matured upon co-transduction of δtat and δrev, or when minimal lentivectors expressing codon-optimized tat and rev were co-transduced in trans (fig. 2g and supplementary fig. 2g). these results indicate that the maturation defect with the individual vectors was due to disruption of tat and rev function, and not due to a cis-acting defect of the mutant rna.the minimal 3-part lentivector expressed gfp from a heterologous promoter and had a deletion mutation encompassing the essential, cis-acting tata box and enhancer elements42, as well as in the trans-acting tat and rev, that inactivated the promoter in the proviral 5′ ltr (fig. 1a). to test the importance of ltr-driven transcription for dc maturation by the hiv-1 provirus, the hiv-1 ltr was restored in the minimal vector (fig. 2h, supplementary fig. 2g, and supplementary table 1); in addition, gfp was inserted in place of gag as a marker for ltr expression, and the heterologous promoter was used to drive tat, rev, or both genes separated by p2a coding sequence (fig. 2h). none of the ltr-driven, minimal vectors matured dcs (fig. 2h and supplementary fig. 2g).to determine if tat was necessary for dc maturation, tat and tar were mutated in hiv-1-gfp and the ltr promoter was modified to be tetracycline-inducible, as previously described43 (tet-hiv-1 in fig. 3a and supplementary table 1). the doxycycline-dependent reverse transactivator (rtta) was delivered in trans by lentivector. in the presence of doxycycline (supplementary table 2), tet-hiv-1 and rtta matured dcs when given in combination, but neither vector matured dcs when given in isolation (fig. 3a and supplementary fig. 3a). additionally, the magnitude of cell surface cd86 was dependent on the doxycycline concentration, indicating that maturation was dependent on the level of hiv-1 transcription (fig. 3b and supplementary fig. 3b). these results demonstrated that tat was not required for maturation, so long as the provirus was expressed.fig. 3rev-mediated rna export is necessary for dc maturation but tat is dispensable. a optimized 2xtet operator43 was cloned into the 3’ltr of hiv-1-gfpδtat to generate tet-hiv-1; the strand-transfer reactions that occur during reverse transcription generate a tet-regulated 5′-ltr in the provirus. dcs transduced with tet-hiv-1, rtta3, or both, were treated for 3 d with 500 ng/ml doxycycline and assayed by flow cytometry for p24, gfp, and cd86. b dcs co-transduced with tet-hiv-1 and rtta3 were treated with increasing concentrations of doxycycline. c to generate hiv-1-rte/cte, the rtem26cte element44 was cloned in place of nef in hiv-1-gfpδrev/δrre. dcs were transduced with the indicated vectors and assessed for p24 and isg15 by flow cytometry. d dcs were treated with 25 nm leptomycin b, transduced with hiv-1-gfp, and assessed for gfp and isg15 by flow cytometry. e dcs were treated with 25 nm leptomycin b, transduced with hiv-1-gfp or infected with sendai virus (sev), and assessed for isg15 by flow cytometry. shown are blood donor data representative of n = 10 (a, c), n = 4 (b), n = 6 (d, e). to determine significance, the mfi of individual flow cytometry samples was calculated as fold-change versus control. when data from each donor replicate within a experiment was combined, the difference in mfi for all experimental vs control conditions was significant in all cases, p < 0.01; one-way anova, dunnett’s post-test against dox negative control for a, b or hiv-1-gfp for c–efull size imagerev-crm1-mediated rna export is necessary for activationto ascertain whether rev was necessary for dc maturation, the rte from a murine intracisternal a-particle retroelement (iap), and the cte from srv-1, were inserted in place of nef (hiv-rte/cte in fig. 3c, supplementary fig. 3c, and supplementary table 1)44. each of these elements utilizes the nxf1 nuclear rna export pathway, thereby bypassing the need for crm1 and rev45. p24 levels with this construct were similar to those of hiv-1-gfp, indicating that unspliced rna was exported from the nucleus at least as well as with rev (fig. 3c). nonetheless, the hiv-rte/cte vector did not mature dcs (fig. 3c and supplementary fig. 3c), indicating that maturation was dependent upon rev and crm1-mediated rna export. consistent with this conclusion , the crm1 inhibitor leptomycin b (supplementary table 2) abrogated dc maturation by hiv-1-gfp (fig. 3d and supplementary fig. 3d). in contrast, leptomycin b had no effect on dc maturation in response to sendai virus infection (fig. 3e and supplementary fig. 3d). isg15 was used to monitor maturation in these experiments since, as previously reported for dcs, leptomycin b altered background levels of cd8646.hiv-1 activates macrophages and cd4+ t cellsto determine if innate immune detection of hiv-1 was unique to dcs, monocyte-derived macrophages and cd4+ t cells were examined. in response to transduction with hiv-1-gfp, macrophages upregulated cd86, isg15, and hla-dr, and cd4+ t cells upregulated mx1, ifit1, and hla-dr (fig. 4a and supplementary fig. 4a-f). dcs, macrophages, and cd4+ t cells were then transduced side-by-side with mutant constructs to determine if the mechanism of innate immune activation was similar to that in dcs. as with dcs, hiv-1-gfp bearing the δgag/pol deletion activated macrophages and cd4+ t cells (fig. 4b and supplementary fig. 4a, d). also in agreement with the dc results, neither the minimal lentivector, nor hiv-1-gfp bearing mutations in integrase, tat, or rev, matured any of the three cell types (fig. 4b and supplementary fig. 4a, d).fig. 4innate immune activation in macrophages and cd4+ t cells. a macrophages and cd4+ t cells were transduced with hiv-1-gfp and assayed 3 days later for the indicated activation markers. b dcs, macrophages, and cd4+ t cells were challenged with hiv-1-gfp or the indicated mutants. when an essential viral component was disrupted within hiv-1-gfp, the factor in question was provided in trans during assembly in transfected hek293 cells, as appropriate (see methods). the upper panel shows flow cytometry of the dcs for gfp and cd86. the histograms show cd86 for dcs and macrophages or mx1 for cd4+ t cells. c 12-day spreading infections on cd4+ t cells with either macrophage-tropic or t cell-tropic, replication-competent hiv-1. d cd4+ t cells were stimulated for 3 days with pha and il2, and transduced with tet-hiv-1 and rtta3. cells were then cultured without stimulation for 9 days. doxycycline was then added at the indicated concentrations. cells were assayed for gfp and mx1 3 days later. shown are blood donor data representative of n = 6 (a), n = 4 (b–d). to determine significance, the mfi of individual flow cytometry samples was calculated as fold-change versus control. the exception being c where the mfi of only gfp+ cells was compared. when data from each donor replicate within a experiment were combined, the difference in mfi for all experimental vs control conditions was significant in all cases, p < 0.01; one-way anova, dunnett’s post-test against lentivector control for a–c or dox control for dfull size imagecd4+ t cells were infected with either macrophage-tropic or t cell-tropic hiv-1 to determine whether replication-competent hiv-1 was similarly capable of innate immune activation in these cells, in the absence of vsv g. as with dcs, innate immune activation, as detected by mx1 and isg15 upregulation, was observed in cells productively infected with hiv-1, but not with minimal lentivector (fig. 4c and supplementary fig. 4g, h). finally, to test the effect of hiv-1 proviral rna on non-activated t cells, cd4+ t cells were co-transduced with tet-hiv-1 and the rtta3 vector, and cultured for 9 days in the absence of stimulation. upon doxycycline treatment, t cells expressed gfp and mx1 (fig. 4d and supplementary fig. 4i). as in dcs, dose-dependent activation was observed with doxycycline (fig. 4d and supplementary fig. 4i). these data indicate that innate immune activation by hiv-1, in all three cell types, requires integration, transcription, and rev-dependent, hiv-1 intron-containing rna.discussion the hiv-1 ltr generates a single primary transcript that gives rise to over 100 alternatively spliced rnas47. the full-length, unspliced, intron-bearing transcript acts as viral genomic rna in the virion and as mrna for essential gag- and pol-encoded proteins. expression of the unspliced transcript requires specialized viral and cellular machinery, hiv-1 rev and crm145, in order to escape from processing by the spliceosome. results here indicate that unspliced or partially spliced hiv-1 rna is detected by human cells as a danger signal, as has been reported for inefficiently spliced mrnas from transposable elements in distantly related eukaryotes48. transposable elements are mutagenic to the host genome and it stands to reason that molecular features such as transcripts bearing multiple, inefficient splice signals characteristic of retrotransposons, would activate innate immune signaling pathways.hiv-1 genomic rna contains extensive secondary and higher order structures that could be detected by innate immune sensors. our knockdown of irf3 and inhibition of tbk1, both required for signal transduction of the rna sensors rig-i, mda5, and tlr3, did not impede hiv-1 maturation of dcs (fig. 2c and supplementary fig. 2b). furthermore, we suppressed an extensive list of innate signaling pathways and sensors including knockdowns of irf’s 1, 5, 7, and 9, stat’s 1 and 2, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of cypa, pkr, c-raf, ikba, nf-kb, mek1 + 2, p38, jnk, caspase 1, pan-caspases, ask1, eif2a, ikke, tak1, or nlrp3 (supplementary fig. 2c and supplementary table 2). none of these perturbations had any effect on limiting innate immune activation by hiv-1, suggesting requirement for an alternative detection mechanism. such mechanisms might include uncharacterized rna sensors, more than one redundantly acting sensors, direct detection of stalled splicing machinery, or overload of the crm1 nuclear export pathway itself.the replication competent hiv-1 reservoir in memory cd4+ t cells has a 44 wk half-life and thus patients must take antiviral medication for life49. long-lived, replication competent hiv-1 reservoirs in other cell types have not been clearly demonstrated, but these may also contribute to the hiv-1 reservoir3. the common genetic determinants in hiv-1 for maturation of cd4+ t cells, macrophages, and dcs suggests that hiv-1 is detected by a mechanism that is conserved across cell types, and that this mechanism would be active in any cell type that possesses a transcriptionally active provirus. data here show that proviruses need not be replication competent to contribute to inflammation. rather, hiv-1 transcription and export of unspliced rna, regardless of replication competence, is sufficient to induce immune activation. this almost certainly contributes to systemic inflammation during acute or untreated chronic infection. whether inflammation is activated in response to provirus expression in cells of patients on antiretroviral therapy remains to be determined. consistent with our findings, t cell activation correlates directly with the level of cell-associated hiv-1 rna in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy50. finally, our data suggests that new drugs that block hiv-1 transcription, tat-mediated transcriptional elongation, or rev-mediated preservation of unspliced transcripts51, would limit inflammation, and offer an important addition to the current anti-hiv-1 drug armamentarium.methodsdata reportingno statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. the

sequence files are available at www.addgene.com.cell culturecells were cultured at 37 °c in 5% co2 humidified incubators and monitored for mycoplasma contamination using the lonza mycoplasma detection kit by lonza (lt07-318). hek293 cells (atcc) were used for viral production and were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 20 mm l-glutamine (thermofisher), 25 mm hepes ph 7.2 (sigmaaldrich), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (thermofisher), and 1× mem non-essential amino acids (thermofisher). cytokine conditioned media was produced from hek293 cells stably transduced with paip-hgmcsf-co (addgene #74168), paip-hil4-co (addgene #74169), or paip-hil2 (addgene #90513), as previously described16.leukopaks were obtained from anonymous, healthy, blood bank donors (new york biologics). as per nih guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/faqs_aps_definitions.htm), experiments with these cells were declared non-human subjects research by the umms irb. pbmcs were isolated from leukopaks by gradient centrifugation on histopaque-1077 (sigma-aldrich). cd14+ mononuclear cells were isolated via positive selection using anti-cd14 antibody microbeads (miltenyi). enrichment for cd14+ cells was routinely >98%.to generate dcs or macrophages, cd14+ cells were plated at a density of 1 to 2 × 106 cells/ml in rpmi-1640 supplemented with 5% heat inactivated human ab+ serum (omega scientific, tarzana, ca), 20 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm hepes ph 7.2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1× mem non-essential amino acids (rpmi-hs complete) in the presence of cytokines that promote differentiation. dcs were generated by culturing monocytes for 6 days in the presence of 1:100 cytokine-conditioned media containing human gm-csf and human il-4. dc preparations were consistently >99% dc-signhigh, cd11chigh, and cd14low by flow cytometry. macrophages were generated by culturing for 7 days with gm-csf conditioned media in the absence of il-4, and were routinely >99% cd11b. cd4+ t cells were isolated from pbmcs that had been depleted of cd14+ cells, as above, using anti-cd4 microbeads (miltenyi), and were >99% cd4+. cd4+ t cells were then cultured in rpmi-1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fbs, 20 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm hepes ph 7.2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× mem non-essential amino acids (rpmi-fbs complete), and 1:2000 il-2 conditioned media. cells from particular donors were excluded from experiments if percent enrichment deviated more than 5% from the numbers mentioned above, or if there was no increase in activation markers in response to control stimuli (lps, sendai virus, and wild-type hiv-1-gfp).hiv-1 vector productionhek293e cells were seeded at 75% confluency in six-well plates and transfected with 6.25μl transit lt1 lipid reagent (mirus) in 250 μl opti-mem (gibco) with 2.25 µg total plasmid dna. 2-part hiv-1 vectors based on hiv-1-gfp29 and described in detail in supplementary table 1 were transfected at a 7:1 ratio in terms of µgs of hiv-1 plasmid dna to pmd2.g vsv g expression plasmid dna16. three-part lentivectors were produced by transfection of the lentivector genome, pspax2 gagpol vector, and pmd2.g, at a dna ratio of 4:3:1. these also include 2-part hiv-1-gfp constructs that are mutated in such a way as to prevent gagpol, tat, or rev production. as these would be defective for viral production, pspax2 was included in the transfections at the same 4:3:1 ratio. vpx-bearing siv-vlps were produced by transfection at a 7:1 plasmid ratio of siv3+ to pmd2.g16. twelve hours after transfection, media was changed to the specific media for the cells that were to be transduced. viral supernatant was harvested 2 days later, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter, and stored at 4 °c.virions in the transfection supernatant were quantified by a pcr-based assay for reverse transcriptase activity16. five microliter transfection supernatant were lysed in 5 μl 0.25% triton x-100, 50 mm kcl, 100 mm tris-hcl ph 7.4, and 0.4 u/μl rnase inhibitor (ribolock, thermofisher). viral lysate was then diluted 1:100 in a buffer of 5 mm (nh4)2so4, 20 mm kcl, and 20 mm tris–hcl ph 8.3. 10 μl was then added to a single-step, rt pcr assay with 35 nm ms2 rna (idt) as template, 500 nm of each primer (5′-tcctgctcaacttcctgtcgag-3′ and 5′-cacaggtcaaacctcctaggaatg-3′), and hot-start taq (promega) in a buffer of 20 mm tris-cl ph 8.3, 5 mm (nh4)2so4, 20 mm kcl, 5 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mg/ml bsa, 1/20,000 sybr green i (invitrogen), and 200 μm dntps. the rt-pcr reaction was carried out in a biorad cfx96 cycler with the following parameters: 42 °c 20 min, 95 °c 2 min, and 40 cycles [95 °c for 5 s, 60 °c 5 s, 72 °c for 15 s and acquisition at 80 °c for 5 s]. two-part vectors typically yielded 107 rt units/µl, and 3 part vector transfections yielded 106 rt units/µl.transductions106 dcs/ml, or 5 × 105 macrophages/ml, were plated into rpmi-hs complete with vpx+ siv-vlp transfection supernatant added at a dilution of 1:6. after 2 h, 108 rt units of viral vector was added. in some cases, drugs were added to the culture media as specified in supplementary table 2. in most cases, transduced dc were harvested for analysis 3 days following challenge. for gene knockdown or for expression of factors in trans, 2 × 106 cd14+ monocytes/ml were transduced directly following magnetic bead isolation with 1:6 volume of siv-vlps and 1:6 volume of vector. when drug selection was required, 4 µg/ml puromycin was added 3 days after monocyte transduction and cells were selected for 3 days. siv-vlps were re-administered in all cases with hiv-1 or lentivector challenge. for dcs in tet-hiv-1 experiments, fresh monocytes were siv-vlp treated and co-transduced with rtta3 and tet-hiv-1. dcs were harvested 6 days later and treated with indicated doxycycline concentrations.for deoxynucleoside-assisted transductions, dcs were plated at 106 dcs/ml and treated with 2 mm of combined deoxynucleosides for 2 h before transduction with hiv-1. deoxynucleosides were purchased from sigma-aldrich (2′deoxyguanosine monohydrate, cat# d0901; thymidine, cat# t1895; 2′deoxyadenosine monohydrate, cat# d8668; 2′deoxycytidine hydrochloride, cat# d0776). a 100 mm stock solution was prepared by dissolving each of the four nucleotides at 100 mm in rpmi 1640 by heating the medium at 80 °c for 15 min.cd4+ t cells were stimulated in rpmi-fbs complete with 1:2000 hil-2 conditioned media and 5 μg/ml pha-p. after 3 days, t cells were replated at 106 cells/ml in rpmi-fbs complete with hil-2. cells were transduced with 108 rt units of viral vector per 106 cells and assayed 3 days later. t cells were co-transduced with rtta3 and tet-hiv-1 every day for 3 days after pha stimulation. cells were then replated in rpmi-fbs complete with hil-2. transduced t cells were cultured for 9 days with fresh media added at day 5. after 9 days, doxycycline was added at the indicated concentrations and assayed 3 days later.non-hiv-1 challenge virusessendai virus cantell strain was purchased from charles river laboratories. infections were performed with 200 ha units/ml on dcs for 3 days before assay by flow cytometry.spreading infectionsdcs were plated at 106 dcs/ml, in rpmi-hs complete media, with or without vpx+ siv-vlp transfection supernatant added at a dilution of 1:6. after 2 h, 108 rt units of hek-293 transfection supernatant of either nl4-3-gfp-jrfl or nl4-3-gfp-jrcsf was added. each is a construct of pnl4-3 in which env was replaced from the end of the signal peptide (therefore retaining the nl4-3 signal peptide and vpu sequence) to the stop codon with either macrophage-tropic jr-fl env (genbank: u63632.1) or t cell-tropic jr-csf env (genbank: m38429.1). every 3 days (for a total of 12 days) samples were harvested for detection of viral rt activity in supernatant and flow cytometry assessment.cd4+ t cells were stimulated in rpmi-fbs complete with 1:2000 hil-2 conditioned media and 5 μg/ml pha-p. after 3 days, t cells were replated at 106 cells/ml in rpmi-fbs complete with hil-2 and transduced with 107 rt units of nl4-3-gfp with jrfl (mac tropic) or jrcsf (t tropic) env. cells were harvested every 3 days (for a total of 12 days) and assayed for infectivity and activation via flow cytometry.supernatant transfer experimentssupernatant from hiv-1-gfp and minimal lentivector challenged dcs was harvested 3 days post transduction. this was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 mins and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove cell debris. dcs of the same individual donors were then treated with the harvested supernatant at a dilution of 1:1000 (1 μl in 1 ml of culture). this was performed in the presence of nevirapine to inhibit secondary infection from remaining, cell free virions. treatments of supernatants of hiv-1 challenged dcs were compared directly to unchallenged dc supernatant treatments.cytokine analysissupernatants from dcs were collected 3 days following transduction with hiv-1-gfp or minimal lentivector. supernatant was spun at 500 × g for 5 mins and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. multiplex soluble protein analysis was carried out by eve technologies (calgary, ab, canada).qrt-pcrtotal rna was isolated from 5 × 105 dcs using rneasy plus mini (qiagen) with turbo dnase (thermofisher) treatment between washes. first-strand synthesis used superscript iii vilo master mix (invitrogen) with random hexamers. qpcr was performed in 20 μl using 1× taqman gene expression master mix (applied biosystems), 1 μl cdna, and 1 μl taqman gene expression assays (thermofisher) specified in supplementary table 3. amplification was on a cfx96 real time thermal cycler (bio-rad) using the following program: 95 °c for 10 min [45 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 60 s]. housekeeping gene oaz1 was used as control16.flow cytometry105 cells were surface stained in facs buffer (pbs, 2% fbs, 0.1% sodium azide), using the antibodies in supplementary table 4. all antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 with the exception of the p24 antibody (kc57 beckmancoulter) which was used at a 1:200 dilution. cells were then fixed in a 1:4 dilution of bd fixation buffer and assayed on a bd c6 accuri. bd biosciences fixation and permeabilization buffers were utilized for intracellular staining. data was analyzed in flowjo.samplingall individual experiments were performed with biological duplicates, using cells isolated from two different blood donors. flow cytometry plots in the figures show representative data taken from experiments performed with cells from the number of donors indicated in the figure legends.statistical analysisexperimental n values and information regarding specific statistical tests can be found in the figure legends. the mean fluorescence intensity for all live cells analyzed under a given condition was calculated as fold-change to negative control/mock. the exception to this methodology was in figs. 1g and 4c where the percent infected cells was too low to use mfi for the bulk population; in these cases mfi was determined for the subset of cells within the gfp+ gate. significance of flow cytometry data was determined via one-way anova. a dunnett’s post-test for multiple comparisons was applied, where mfi fold change was compared to either mock treatment or positive treatment depending on the experimental question. qrt-pcr and luminex data was analyzed via two-way anova, with dunnett’s post-test comparing all samples to mock. all anovas were performed using prism 7.02 software (graphpad software, la jolla, ca).

Epithelial Cells and Fibroblasts from the Human Female Reproductive Tract Accumulate and Release TFV and TAF to Sustain Inhibition of HIV Infection of CD4+ T cells,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38205-y,Research,12 February 2019,yes,"tenofovir (tfv) treatment of female reproductive tract (frt) cells results in differential accumulation of intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (tfv-dp) in different cell types, with greater concentrations in epithelial cells (100-fold) and fibroblasts (10-fold) than in cd4+ t cells. the possibility that tfv-dp accumulation and retention in epithelial cells and fibroblasts may alter tfv availability and protection of cd4+ t cells against hiv infection, prompted us to evaluate tfv and/or tenofovir alafenamide (taf) release from frt cells. endometrial, endocervical and ectocervical polarized epithelial cells and fibroblasts were pre-loaded with tfv or taf, and secretions tested for their ability to inhibit hiv infection of activated blood cd4+ t cells. epithelial cell basolateral secretions (1, 2 and 3 days post-loading), but not apical secretions, suppressed hiv infection of cd4+ t cells, as did secretions from pre-loaded fibroblasts from each site. intracellular tfv-dp levels in epithelial cells following preloading with tfv or taf correlated directly with arv protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection. when added apically to epithelial cells, tfv/taf was released basolaterally, in part through multidrug resistant protein transporters, taken up by fibroblasts and released into secretions to partially protect cd4+ t cells. these findings demonstrate that epithelial cells and fibroblasts release tfv/taf for use by cd4+ t cells and suggest that the tissue environment plays a major role in the sustained protection against hiv infection.
introduction half of the people infected with hiv worldwide are women1. in endemic areas like sub-sharan africa however, women are at disproportionate increased risk for hiv acquisition compared to men, and hiv is the main cause of death for reproductive age women2. sexual transmission is the main route for hiv acquisition in women, therefore, preventive strategies in women need to be effective in the female reproductive tract (frt). the immune system in the frt has the dual role of protecting against infections while allowing pregnancy to occur3. to this end, immune cells in the frt are tightly regulated by sex hormones and the tissue environment, which control immune cell distribution and function3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.central to the strategy of preventing the sexual transmission of hiv to women is the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), in which antiretrovirals (arvs) such as tenofovir (tfv) are delivered topically into the vagina or taken orally as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (tdf/ftc; truvada). oral prep11 was shown in several trials to protect against hiv-1 infection in heterosexual men and women12,13,14. in contrast, only one trial (caprisa 004) using topical tfv applied in the vagina has shown significant protection against hiv acquisition in women, while several other trials involving only women, using topical or oral prep (fem prep, facts, and voice) have shown no protective effect15,16,17. beyond compliance, the success or failure of arvs depends on effective concentrations of arvs being achieved and maintained in those tissue cells (cd4+ t cells and macrophages) susceptible to hiv-1 infection.tfv and its prodrug tenofovir alafenamide (taf) are hiv nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors that act via their integration into nascent viral dna to prevent transcription of the viral rna into viral dna, a key early step in the hiv lifecycle. tfv and taf, differ in their ability to enter cells. tfv with its inherent negative charge is poorly taken up by cells and is dependent on limited diffusion as well as energy dependent transporters18,19,20,21. taf, due to its neutral charge, readily diffuses into the cell, although transporters may also be involved in cell entry22. thus taf achieves similar protection against hiv infection at concentrations ~300 fold lower than tfv7. intracellular taf is readily converted to tfv via the actions of cathepsin a. once in the cell, tfv is converted into tfv-diphosphate (tfv-dp) through two sequential phosphorylation reactions23. it is tfv-dp, the active metabolite of tfv and taf, which interferes with viral replication.previous studies by us evaluated the intracellular concentrations of tfv-dp (the active form of tfv) in purified immune and non-immune cells from the upper and lower human frt24. we found that concentrations of tfv-dp were 100-fold higher in epithelial cells and 10-fold higher in fibroblasts when compared to cd4+ t cells and macrophages. in other studies, the distribution of tfv-dp was analyzed using combined confocal raman spectroscopy (crs) and optical coherence tomography (oct) to measure the distribution of tfv in intact porcine vaginal tissues25,26. measured with sub-100-micron spatial resolution, the concentration of tfv following topical application was greatest in the epithelium and rapidly diminished deeper in the stroma. taken together, these findings indicate a cell-specific distribution of tfv-dp in the reproductive tract and demonstrate that tissue biopsy concentrations may not reflect the physiologically-relevant concentrations of an arv needed to prevent the sexual transmission of hiv. the recognition that arvs are not uniformly distributed between cells in the reproductive tract emphasizes the need to understand the role of the tissue environment in modulating protection and susceptibility to hiv infection.when tfv is applied topically into the vagina, it first enters epithelial cells at the apical (luminal) surface after which it is released basolaterally into the subepithelial (stromal) compartment, possibly through several mechanisms, including passive diffusion and/ or transporters, such as breast cancer resistant protein (bcrp) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) or multidrug resistant proteins (mrp)27,28,29. in contrast, following oral administration, tfv reaches the subepithelial stroma of the reproductive tract through the blood stream30. important differences have been described in tfv-dp vaginal levels after topical and oral administration of tfv31,32. whether epithelial cells and fibroblasts act as a sink for tfv-dp to compromise protection, or release tfv slowly after initial uptake to maintain protection in the genital mucosa is unknown.using polarized primary epithelial cells and fibroblasts from the endometrium (em), endocervix (cx) and ectocervix (ecx), we examined whether tfv- and/or taf-derived intracellular accumulation of tfv-dp enhances or inhibits tfv-mediated protection against hiv by interfering with availability to cd4+ t cells. when epithelial cells were pre-loaded with tfv or taf, we found that both arvs were released basolaterally for at least 3 days at concentrations that provide partial protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection, and that arv release was partially due to multidrug resistant protein (mrp) transporters. these findings demonstrate that epithelial cells and fibroblasts contribute to mucosal protection against hiv throughout the frt by acting as an arv reservoir that extends partial protection following arv administration.materials and methodsethics statementall human subject work was carried out with the approval of the dartmouth college institutional review board. approval to use tissues was previously obtained from the committee for the protection of human subjects (cphs), and with written informed consent obtained from the patient before surgery. all samples were anonymized, and all investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki.source of tissue and bloodhuman frt tissues were obtained immediately following surgery from women who had undergone hysterectomies at dartmouth-hitchcock medical center (lebanon, nh). tissues from the endometrium (em), endocervix (cx) and ectocervix (ecx) were collected from patients with benign conditions such as fibroids and prolapse (age from 26 to 61 years old). tissue samples were distal from the sites of pathology and were without pathological lesions as determined by a pathologist. blood donors were anonymous, no information regarding age or hormonal status was available and only female donors were used in this study.preparation of blood cd4+ t cellsblood from women was obtained from our irb-approved blood donor program at dartmouth-hitchcock medical center. cd4+ t cells were purified with the cd4+ t cell isolation kit (miltenyi biotech) from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) as described before5,8. purified blood cd4+ t cells were activated in vitro using x-vivo 15 media (lonza, walkersville, md) with phenol red plus phytohemagglutinin (pha, 2.5 µg/ml; sigma, st louis, mo) and il-2 (50 u/ml, aids research and reference reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih: human ril-2 from dr. maurice gately, hoffmann- la roche inc.) for 24 hr as described previously5,8. activated cd4+ t cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in round-bottom 96-well culture plates (corning, corning, ny) in 0.1 ml of immune cell media consisting of x-vivo 15 media supplemented with phenol red and 10% human ab serum (valley biomedical, winchester, va) prior to treatment.tissue processingtissues were rinsed with hbss (hanks balanced salt solution) supplemented with phenol red, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all thermo scientific hyclone, logan, ut), and 0.35 mg/ml naco3 (thermo fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa) and processed as previously described7,8,33,34. tissues were then minced under sterile conditions into 1-2 mm fragments and digested at 37 °c for 1 hr using a mixture containing (final concentrations): 0.05% collagenase type iv (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) and 0.01% dnase (worthington biochemical, lakewood, nj) in hbss (invitrogen life technologies, grand island, ny). type iv collagenase was selected based on preliminary studies to ensure non-cleavage of surface markers4,6. after digestion, cells were dispersed through a 250-µm nylon mesh screen (small parts, miami lakes, fl), washed, and resuspended in complete media consisting of dmem/f12 medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10 mm hepes (both gibco, life technologies, grand island, ny), 100 µg/ml primocin (invivogen, san diego, ca), 2 mm l-glutamine, 2.5% heat-inactivated defined fetal bovine serum (fbs) (both from thermo scientific hyclone) and 2.5% nuserum (bd biosciences, bedford, ma). epithelial cell sheets were separated from stromal cells by filtration through a 20-µm mesh filter (small parts). epithelial cell sheets were retained on the filter, while stromal cells passed through.isolation and culture of frt epithelial cells and stromal fibroblastsepithelial cell sheets were recovered by rinsing and backwashing the filter with complete medium, centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min and analyzed for cell number and viability as previously described7,24,34. to establish a cell culture system of polarized human frt epithelial cells with both apical and basolateral compartments, frt epithelial cells were cultured in matrigel matrix (bd biosciences) coated falcon cell culture inserts in 24-well companion culture plates (fisher scientific). apical and basolateral compartments contained 300 and 500 µl of complete medium, respectively, which was changed every 2 days. tight junction formation of epithelial cell monolayers from em and cx was assessed by periodically measuring transepithelial resistance (ter) using an evom electrode and voltammeter (world precision instruments, sarasota, fl), as described previously35. to keep the culture conditions similar, the same procedure was followed for culturing squamous ecx epithelial cells, which do not polarize.stromal fibroblasts were isolated as previously described7,34,36. briefly, following removal of epithelial sheets, the flow-through containing stromal fibroblasts and immune cells was collected, centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended, cell number and viability determined. freshly isolated stromal fibroblasts and immune cells were incubated in complete medium in a t75 cell culture flask (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa). media was replaced every 48 hr to remove non-adherent cells. once cells reached confluence, they were trypsinized and plated at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well culture plates (fisher scientific) for at least 48 hr prior to treatment.tfv and taf preparationtfv in powder form was obtained from aids research and reference reagent program (nih aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih: tenofovir, catalog number 10199). a stock concentration of tfv 5 mg/ml was prepared by adding 1 ml of pbs to 5 mg of tfv powder, before being diluted in stripped media to the appropriate working concentration7,8,24,37. taf was kindly supplied by gilead sciences inc. (foster city, ca) and was dissolved in pbs at 10 mm, sterilely filtered (0.2 um) and the concentration checked by absorbance using a molar extinction coefficient of 11690 at 260 nm7,8. subsequent dilutions of tfv and taf were made in complete media to the appropriate working concentrations.intracellular tfv-dp measurementtfv or taf were added to polarized epithelial cells both apically (lumen) and basolaterally (tissue) compartments for 24 hr. for some experiments, tfv and taf were added only apically as indicated in the results. after treatment, cells were washed, harvested and lysed in 300 µl of 70% methanol, and stored immediately at −80 °c prior to tfv-dp evaluation as previously described8,24. intracellular tfv-dp concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) and normalized values to fmol/million cells based on the number of cells per sample32.collection of secretions from epithelial cells and fibroblaststfv or taf were added to polarized epithelial cells both apically (lumen) and basolaterally (tissue) compartments for 24 hr, or only apically, as indicated. the time of measurement of tfv-dp used in this study and in our previous research7,8,24, was based on the initial clinical trial (caprisa 004) which used topical tfv applied in the vagina and reported significant protection against hiv acquisition in women when taken between 24 hr prior to sexual intercourse to 24 hr after sex15. following incubation, cells were washed in media 3 times to remove extracellular tfv or taf, after which epithelial cell inserts were transferred into new wells and fresh media was added to both the apical and basolateral compartments. conditioned media (cm) were recovered from apical and basolateral compartments of cell inserts after 24 hr. similarly, tfv or taf was added to stromal fibroblasts grown to confluence in 24-well plates for 24 hr, after which they were washed repeatedly prior to the addition of fresh media to collect cm at 24 hr. for epithelial cell time course experiments, media in each compartment was replaced at 24 hr intervals (1, 2, and 3 days), cm was collected at each time point. to evaluate the interaction between epithelial cells and fibroblasts, polarized epithelial cell inserts were transferred to 24-well plates containing confluent subject-paired fibroblast cultures. tfv or taf were added to polarized epithelial cells apically for 24 hr, after which basolateral cm was collected. at the end of this incubation, cell inserts and incubation chambers +/− fibroblasts were washed thoroughly both apically and basolaterally so that both epithelial cells and fibroblasts were free of any extracellular tfv or taf. cells were then divided in to 2 separate groups consisting of ec inserts transferred to new wells (no fibroblasts), and fibroblasts in the lower chamber alone (no ec inserts). in each of these combinations, fresh media lacking arvs was added and cells incubated for an additional 24 hr after which conditioned media (containing released intracellular arvs) was recovered and analyzed for anti-hiv activity.inhibition of multidrug resistance-associated protein (mrps)to evaluate the role of mrps in arv movement, epithelial cells were incubated with tfv or taf for 20 hr, followed by the addition of human mrp-specific inhibitor mk571 (sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo) for 4 hr. mk571 was added in 250 µl of complete media to both the apical and basolateral compartments and was present in the fresh media following cell rinsing and incubation. cm was collected from apical and basolateral compartments of cell inserts after 24 hr. cm was centrifuged at 10,000 g and stored at −80 °c until hiv infection assay. untreated control cells were donor-matched to treated cells and processed in parallel at the same time. cell viability was tested after treatment using the celltiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay (promega, madison, wi, usa) and trypan blue staining (hyclone laboratories, inc., logan, ut) as described before7,8. all samples were assayed blind without any information provided as to cell origin and treatment.hiv-infectionactivated blood cd4+ t cells were infected as previously described with minor modifications5,8. stock for hiv-bal (r5) was obtained through the aids research and reference reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih, from dr. suzanne gartner, dr. mikulas popovic and dr. robert gallo38. briefly, activated blood cd4+ t cells were incubated with apical and basolateral epithelial cell or fibroblast cm for 24 hr and then washed with pbs prior to hiv infection. after washing, cells were incubated with hiv-bal for 2 hr at an moi of 0.1 and then washed to remove residual virus. fresh 0.2 ml il-2 supplemented immune cell media was added to each well and cells were incubated for 5 days, with half of the media from each well collected and replaced with fresh media on day 3. released p24 in the culture media on day 5 was measured by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (advanced bioscience laboratories, rockville, md) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.rna isolation and quantitative rt-pcr analysisreal-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was done with a two-step protocol as described previously34,36. total rna was isolated from epithelial cells using rneasy reagent (qiagen, valencia, ca) and qiashredder columns according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (qiagen), and purified by elution through rneasy columns (qiagen) with on-column dnase digestion using the rnase-free dnase set (qiagen). for each specimen, 400 ng of total rna was reverse-transcribed using the iscript complementary dna (cdna) synthesis kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. relative mrna expression levels of genes of interest were measured using the 5′ fluorogenic nuclease assay in real-time quantitative pcr using taqman chemistry on the abi 7300 prism real-time pcr instrument (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the 5 members from human multidrug resistance-associated protein family (mrp1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) (id nos. hs01561483_m1, hs00978452_m1, hs00988721_m1, hs00981089_m1, hs01077866_m1, respectively) and β-actin (4333762 f) primer/mgb probe sets were obtained from applied biosystems assays-on-demand. the 4 epithelial cell tight junction genes analyzed included tjp1 (zona occluden 1) (id nos. hs01551861_m1), ocln (occludin) (id nos. hs00170162_m1), cldn2 (id nos. hs00252666_s1) and 4 (id nos. hs00533616_s1) (claudin 2 and 4). pcr was conducted using the following cycle parameters: 12 min at 95 °c for one cycle, followed by 40 cycles of 20 seconds at 95 °c and 1 min at 60 °c. analysis was conducted using the sequence detection software supplied with the abi 7300. the software calculates the threshold cycle (ct) for each reaction and this was used to quantify the amount of starting template in the reaction. the ct values for each set of duplicate reactions were averaged for all subsequent calculations. a difference in ct values (δct) was calculated for each gene by taking the mean ct of each gene of interest and subtracting the mean ct for the housekeeping gene β-actin for each cdna sample. the relative expression level of each gene was calculated using the formula 2−δct.statisticsdata analysis was performed using the graphpad prism 5.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca). a two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. comparison of three or more groups was performed applying kruskal-wallis test for non-matched samples or friedman test for matched samples, followed by dunns-post test for multiple comparison correction. comparison studies of hiv infections in the absence vs presence of inhibitor mk571 or accumulation of tfv-dp from apical and basolateral treatment and time course studies were analyzed using two-way anova with bonferroni post-test for multiple comparison correction.resultsconversion of tfv and taf into intracellular tfv-dp by endometrial epithelial cellsin order to compare the protective effects of tfv and taf, studies were undertaken to ensure that comparable concentrations of tfv-dp were present in polarized endometrial (em) epithelial cells following incubation with each arv. these studies were carried out based on the recognition that taf is administered clinically at lower doses than tfv and that intracellular conversion of taf into tfv-dp is much more efficient than tfv22. em epithelial cells were treated with different doses of tfv or taf for 24 hr and intracellular levels tfv-dp were determined7. using this data as a standard curve, we then calculated tfv and taf doses that would result in equal amounts of intracellular tfv-dp to compare both drugs side by side. as seen in fig. 1a and presented elsewhere7, we predetermined the dose for each arv that would give the same intracellular concentration of tfv-dp. incubation with tfv at 3 concentrations (33, 328, and 3277 μm) and taf (0.1, 1, and 10 μm) resulted in equivalent amounts of intracellular tfv-dp. exposure for 24 hr was chosen based on our previous publications7,24 and the initial clinical trial (caprisa 004) that reported significant protection against hiv acquisition in women that applied topical tfv in the vagina 24 hr prior to sexual intercourse15,39. the findings presented here provide the foundation for comparisons in the following sections that measure the effectiveness of arvs released into secretions for their ability to protect target cells from hiv infection.figure 1evaluation of the protective effect of secretions from endometrial epithelial cells following preincubation with tfv or taf on hiv infection of blood cd4+ t cells. (a) dose-dependent increase in intracellular tfv-dp levels following treatment of purified polarized endometrial (em) epithelial cells with taf (white bars) or tfv (black bars) for 24 hr. bars and horizontal lines represent mean and sem respectively from triplicate cultures of cells from a representative patient. values are expressed as fmol/million cells. (b,c) levels of hiv infection (released p24) in cd4+ t cells after incubation with apical and basolateral cm from em epithelial cells pre-treated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) as described in methods. (b) representative example of secreted p24 levels from a single patient run in quadruplicate. columns and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. (c) secreted p24 values are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) which is set to 100%. each circle represents an individual patient (n = 10) and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem. blood cd4+ t cells were isolated from 4 donors. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.full size imagebasolateral secretions from polarized endometrial epithelial cells incubated with tfv or taf protect cd4+ t cells from hiv infectionbased on our findings in fig. 1a, the concentrations of tfv (3277 μm) and taf (10 μm) were selected to evaluate whether preloaded polarized endometrial epithelial cells release their products in a way that confers protection against hiv infection. after incubation with tfv or taf for 24 hr followed by extensive washing to remove excess arvs, epithelial cells were incubated for an additional 24 hr in fresh media prior to recovery of apical and basolateral conditioned media (cm). this cm should contain any tfv or taf released by epithelial cells. to test if released tfv from epithelial cells would confer protection, activated blood cd4+ t cells were incubated with apical or basolateral cm for 24 hr prior to in vitro hiv infection as detailed in methods. as shown in fig. 1b, in a representative experiment, basolateral cm from tfv and taf treated polarized epithelial cells, but not apical cm, significantly inhibited hiv infection of cd4+ t cells. as seen in fig. 1c, when 10 patients were evaluated, we found that following epithelial preloading with tfv or taf, basolaterally secreted cm protected against hiv infection (mean inhibition = 60% and 80% respectively). in all of these experiments, apical secretions showed no evidence of protection.to determine whether protection by basolateral secretions persisted beyond 24 hr, cm was collected and replaced with fresh media daily for 3 days. as seen in fig. 2a, protection by tfv and taf in basolateral secretions persisted for 3 days in that each conferred partial protection against hiv infection of cd4+ t cells. by day 3, protection relative to media controls was lower than that measured on day 1. despite this decline, significant inhibition of infection by hiv of activated cd4+ t cells was observed in 4/4 experiments. this progressive decline in hiv-protection correlated with a slow decline in intracellular tfv-dp levels in the epithelial cells (fig. 2b,c). interestingly, combining the data for the percent inhibition of cd4+ t cells to tfv-dp levels for both tfv- and taf-treated epithelial cells yielded a smooth curve showing a 50 percent inhibition corresponding to a tfv-dp concentration of ~340,000 fmol/million cells (suppl. fig. 1a). this correlation between epithelial cell tfv-dp levels and protection to cd4+ t cells from hiv supports our hypothesis that protection is due to basolateral release of tfv and taf into the basolateral secretions of epithelial cells. at no time was protection by arvs evident in apical cm over the course of these experiments, demonstrating that ec-release of tfv is selective towards the subepithelial (tissue) compartment.figure 2protective anti-hiv effect of basolateral secretions from endometrial (em) epithelial cells following treatment with tfv or taf correlates with epithelial levels of intracellular tfv-dp. (a) hiv infection levels in cd4+ t cells after incubation with cm from em epithelial cells pre-treated with tfv or taf. em epithelial cells were pre-treated with either tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr, after which arvs were washed out of cell culture. cells were then incubated with fresh media that was replaced daily for an initial 24 hr (day 1), a second 24 hr period (day 2), and a third 24 hr period (day 3) after which basolateral conditioned media (cm) was collected. activated cd4+ t cells were treated for 24 hr with cm recovered at day 1, 2, and 3. following washout of cm, cd4+ t cells were infected after which secreted p24 levels measured by p24 elisa after 5 days as described in methods. data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) which is set to 100% (dashed line). (n = 4 individual patients). columns and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. ***p < 0.001. (b and c) intracellular tfv-dp levels in em epithelial cells are inversely related to hiv infection of cd4+ t cells treated with em epithelial cm. intracellular tfv-dp levels in em epithelial cells were measured by lc-ms/ms following tfv (b) and taf (c) treatment (24 hr), followed by incubation for 24 hr intervals with fresh media collection on day 1, day 2, and day 3. cm was collected at each time point along with cell recovery to measure hiv infection as described in methods. circles and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem from triplicates in a single representative patient. (d) time course of the lack of an effect on transepithelial resistance (ter) of polarized epithelial cells treated with tfv (3277 µm) for 24 hr after which arv was washed out of cell culture. cells were then incubated with fresh media that was replaced daily for 3 days. (e) lack of an effect of tfv and taf on epithelial cell viability. polarized em epithelial cells were apically and basolaterally treated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr prior to washout and measurement of viability on days 1, 2 and 3. cell viability was tested with celltiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay. the bars represent the mean and sem of triplicate cell inserts. (f) intracellular accumulation of tfv-dp on endometrial epithelial cells following apical or basolateral incubation with tfv or taf. intracellular tfv-dp levels were measured by lc-ms/ms in purified polarized endometrial epithelial cells treated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) apical or basolateral for 24 hr. values are expressed as fmol/million cells. the bars represent the mean and sem from 3 patients. **p < 0.01.full size imagerecognizing that cell integrity is essential, we measured transepithelial resistance (ter) both prior to the addition of tfv and following its addition and wash out both apically and basolaterally for 3 days in culture. as seen in fig. 2d, when ter was measured daily tfv treatment had no significant effect on ter, indicating that cell and barrier integrity was maintained throughout the course of our experiments. in parallel, we measured the impact of arvs on tight junction gene expression and found that tfv had no effect on tjp1, ocld, cldn2 and cldn4 mrna expression in polarized epithelial cells (suppl. fig. 1b). as a further indicator of cell viability, in separate studies, polarized em epithelial cells were pretreated with tfv (3277 μm) and taf (10 μm) for 24 hr, prior to measuring viability at 24 hr intervals for 3 days. as shown in fig. 2e, no changes in viability were found for either arv. these data demonstrate that the protective arv levels found in the basolateral compartment in our studies are not due to arv leakage through epithelial damage.recognizing that arvs following preloading are preferentially released basolaterally, we investigated whether cell uptake of tfv and taf also exhibited polarity. as seen in fig. 2f, we found that directional application (apical vs basolateral) of tfv and/or taf influenced tfv-dp concentrations within epithelial cells. when measured after 24 hr incubation, epithelial cells incubated basolaterally with tfv had 2–3 fold more tfv-dp than did matched cells incubated apically with tfv. in contrast, taf applied to either the apical or basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells resulted in comparable intracellular concentrations of tfv-dp.overall, these findings indicate that epithelial cells preloaded with either tfv or taf gradually release arvs basolaterally in a way that confers partial tissue protection of cd4+ t cells that persists for days.endocervical and ectocervical basolateral secretions from arv-treated polarized epithelial cells protect against hiv infectionthe possibility that the release pattern of arvs was unique to endometrial epithelial cells prompted us to ask if epithelial cells from other sites in the frt might share a similar pattern of arv release. purified endocervical (cx) and ectocervical (ecx) epithelial cells were grown to confluence, incubated with tfv or taf for 24 hr and washed to remove excess arvs after which cm was collected for 24 hr. when cells were preloaded with tfv or taf, basolateral cm from cx (fig. 3a) and ecx (fig. 3b) epithelial cells protected against hiv infection of cd4+ t cells. importantly, similar to em epithelial cells, apical cm from cx and ecx cells had no protective effect against hiv infection. in other studies, we found that basolateral secretions collected at 24 hr intervals (days 1, 2 and 3) also protected against hiv infection, similar to that seen with em epithelial cells (fig. 3c). therefore, em, cx and ecx epithelial cells shared a pattern of tfv and taf-derived release that was gradual and primarily basolateral towards the underlying stroma.figure 3secretions from endocervical and ectocervical epithelial cells treated with tfv or taf inhibit hiv infection of cd4+ t cells. apical and basolateral conditioned media (cm) were collected from endocervix (cx) and ectocervix (ecx) epithelial cells pre-treated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr. cm were collected 24 hr post arv washout and incubation with fresh media; cm was incubated with activated cd4+ t cells prior to hiv infection. secreted p24 levels in the culture media after 5 days of infection were measured by p24 elisa as described in methods. data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) which is set to 100% using (a) cm from cx epithelial cells from 9 patients, (b) cm from ecx epithelial cells from 4 patients. (c) time course of hiv protection of cd4+ t cells by basolateral cm from cx (dark circles) and ecx (open circles) epithelial cells pre-treated with either arvs for 24 hr prior to wash out. cells were then incubated with fresh media that was replaced each day for 3 days, basolateral cm was collected daily. activated cd4+ t cells were treated for 24 hr with cm. following washout of cm, cd4+ t cells were infected after which secreted p24 levels measured by p24 elisa as described in methods. data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) which is set to 100% (dashed line). (n = 7 individual patients). columns and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.full size imagestromal fibroblasts from the frt are a reservoir for gradual arv releaseour previous studies indicated that in addition to epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts from the frt also concentrate intracellular tfv-dp approximately 10 fold higher than frt cd4+ t cells24. to determine whether fibroblast secretions from the em, cx and ecx were capable of protecting cd4+ t cells from hiv infection, fibroblasts grown to confluence in 24 well plates were incubated with either tfv (3277 μm) or taf (10 μm) for 24 hr. following repeated washes, cells were incubated for an additional 24 hr in fresh media prior to collection of cm for analysis. as shown in fig. 4a,b, cm from em as well as cx and ecx fibroblasts preloaded with tfv and taf were capable of partially protecting activated cd4+ t cells from infection by hiv (30–50% protection).figure 4effect of fibroblasts and endometrial (em) epithelial cells in decreased hiv infection of cd4+ t cells. conditioned media (cm) was collected from (a) endometrium (em), (b) cx/ecx fibroblasts pre-treated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr. cm were collected 24 hr post arv washout and incubation with fresh media; cm was incubated with activated cd4+ t cells prior to hiv infection. secreted p24 levels in the culture media after 5 days of infection were measured by p24 elisa as described in methods. cm was collected from em fibroblasts of 5 patients while cm from cx (dark circle) and ecx (open circle) fibroblasts was from 3 matched patients. each circle represents an individual patient. data are normalized in (a,b) to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) and set to 100%. each circle represents a different patient. blood cd4+ t cells were isolated from 4 donors. horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. (c) polarized em epithelial cells were apically treated with tfv or taf for 24 hr, after which basolateral cm was immediately collected (arv-incubation). following rinsing, cells were incubated with fresh media (no tfv or taf) for an additional 24 hr prior to cm collection (post-incubation 24 hr). activated cd4+ t cells from blood were incubated with cm for 24 hr and washed and infected with hiv for 2 hr. secreted viral p24 levels were measured after 5 days of infection (methods). data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) which is set to 100%. bars represent em tissues from 3 patients. (d) effect of epithelial cells and fibroblasts on prevention of hiv infection. polarized em epithelial cells grown in the upper chamber of cell inserts were treated apically with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr in the presence of confluent fibroblasts (sf) from the same donor grown in the lower chamber (no cell contact). following incubation, epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts (ec + sf), basolateral cm was collected for analysis (arv-incubation). following extensive washing to remove extracellular arvs (post-incubation), epithelial cells alone (ec) and stromal fibroblasts alone (sf) were incubated in fresh media for 24 hr, after which cm were collected. cd4+ t cell protection against hiv infection for each cm was measured as described in methods. data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control). bars represent 4 patients. blood cd4+ t cells were isolated from 2 donors. column and horizontal lines represents the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.full size imageprotection by basolateral secretions from polarized em epithelial cells incubated apically with arvsin topical pre-exposure prophylaxis studies, tfv is deposited in the vagina at the epithelial cell surface after which it moves upstream into the ecx, cx and em and into the underlying stroma containing cd4+ t cells28,32. to mimic the movement of arvs from the luminal surface, polarized epithelial cells were treated apically with tfv or taf followed by basolateral cm collection after 24 hr incubation. following multiple washes of epithelial cells, cells were incubated with fresh media for an additional 24 hr after which cm was collected. as seen in fig. 4c, when cm from the initial incubation with tfv or taf was evaluated, complete protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection was observed (fig. 4c; arv-incubation). additionally, cm collected 24 hr after washout conferred partial protection (fig. 4c; arv-post-incubation), demonstrating continued basolateral release of arvs by epithelial cells following cell washing of initial arv input. these findings indicate that under conditions of apical exposure, arvs continue to be released basolaterally after the apical source of arv is removed.to further mimic the interactions of arvs with the cells present below the epithelium, we apically treated polarized epithelial cells with tfv or taf for 24 hr during which stromal fibroblasts were present beneath but not in contact with epithelial cells (fig. 4d). we found that basolateral cm collected during the first 24 hr from epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts is able to fully protect cd4+ t cells from infection. following repeated washings, epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts were incubated separately (post-incubation) for an additional 24 hr in fresh media. under these conditions, both epithelial cells and fibroblasts released arvs in sufficient concentrations to partially protect cd4+ t cells from hiv infection. this study demonstrates that under conditions of apical epithelial cell exposure, arvs move to the basolateral compartment to be taken up by fibroblasts for subsequent release and protection of cd4+ t cells. these studies suggest that in situ, both epithelial cells and fibroblasts release arvs that contribute to the protection of cd4+ t cells in stromal tissues of the frt.multidrug resistance-associated proteins (mrp) are partially responsible for selective transport of arvs into the subepithelial compartmentour finding of preferential basolateral release by epithelial cells of arvs at concentrations capable of protecting underlying cells from infection, suggested that arv release may in part be mediated through active transport. mrp1 and mrp3 have been reported to be selectively expressed in the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells and mediate tfv transport outside the cell40. to determine whether primary frt epithelial cells contain mrps, polarized epithelial cells from the em, cx and ecx were analyzed for the presence of mrp1, mrp3, mrp4, mrp5 and mrp6. as seen in fig. 5a, epithelial cells from all 3 sites expressed mrps, with mrp1 and mrp3 expressed at significantly higher levels than mrp4, mrp5 and mrp6.figure 5blockade of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (mrp) leads in part to decreased anti-hiv activity in basolateral epithelial cm via increased intracellular accumulation of tfv-dp. (a) mrp (1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) gene expression in epithelial cells from endometrium (em), endocervix (cx) and ectocervix (ecx). gene expression was determined by real time rt-pcr and normalized to β-actin using epithelial cells from 4 patients with matched em, cx and ecx. y axis represents gene expression relative to the house keeping gene β-actin. columns and horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. (b) blockade of mrp transporter function decreases the release of tfv and taf into the extracellular environment. em epithelial cells were incubated with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 20 hr, followed by the addition of a human mrp-specific inhibitor mk571 (100 µm) to both the apical and basolateral compartments for 4 hr. following washout, fresh media +/− mk571 (100 um) was added to both compartments for an additional 24 hr after which the basolateral cm was collected. activated cd4+ t cells from blood were incubated with basolateral cm for 24 hr prior to hiv infection (methods). data were normalized to % of hiv infection of cd4+ t cells infected in the absence of basolateral cm (media control). each circle represents a different individual patient (n = 6) with dark circles representing basolateral cm collected from cells not treated with mk571, and open circles basolateral cm from cells treated with mk571 data are normalized to the infection of cd4+ t cells in the absence of cm (media control) and set to 100%. *p < 0.05. (c) intracellular tfv-dp levels in purified polarized em epithelial cells increase following incubation with tfv (3277 µm) or taf (10 µm) for 24 hr in the presence of mk571 (100 µm). data were normalized to % of intracellular tfv-dp without mk571 in experiments using em epithelial cells from 4 individual patients. each circle represents a different patient. horizontal lines represent the mean and sem respectively. *p < 0.05.full size imagebased on these findings, we hypothesized that mrp transporters might in part be responsible for the preferential basolateral release of tfv and taf from polarized epithelial cells. to test this, em epithelial cells were incubated with tfv or taf for 20 hr after which the human mrp-specific inhibitor mk571 was added to apical and basolateral compartments for 4 hr41. mk571 was present in wash media and during the following 24 hr when cells were placed in fresh media. if mrps are responsible for basolateral transport of tfv, we would expect that after mrp blockade less tfv would be released into the cm resulting in increased infection of cd4+ t cells by hiv. as see in fig. 5b, mk571 partially reversed the protective effect of basolateral cm from arv-treated epithelial cells, for both tfv and taf by increasing hiv infection, but had no effect on viral infection in the absence of arvs. to test if this effect could be maximized, mk571 was added at the start of incubation along with tfv or taf for 24 hr prior to the collection of cm after washing cells and further incubation. we found that extended exposure did not further inhibit arv release beyond that seen when mk571 was added for the last 4 hrs of culture (not shown).to confirm that mk571 was biologically active, we measured intracellular tfv-dp levels in epithelial cells incubated with tfv and taf for 24 hr in the presence of mk571. as seen in fig. 5c, mk571 treatment resulted in a modest but significant increase in intracellular tfv-dp in epithelial cells. this increase in tfv-dp correlated with the loss of hiv protection when cd4+ t cells were incubated with basolateral cm from arv-treated epithelial cells, suggesting a decreased efflux of tfv from epithelial cells. overall, these findings indicate that mrps contribute partially to the basolateral release of tfv in the direction of stromal tissues.discussion overall, our studies demonstrate that following incubation with arvs, em, cx and ecx epithelial cells and fibroblasts retain and subsequently release tfv or taf that provide downstream protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv acquisition. arv release by polarized epithelial cells is selective towards the subepithelial (basolateral) compartment, where it can be taken up by underlying fibroblasts. together, both epithelial cells and fibroblasts gradually release arvs to protect cd4+ t cells. following apical tfv or taf administration, there is complete protection from hiv infection for the first 24 hr. however, after drug removal, epithelial cells and fibroblasts act as tissue reservoirs that slowly release tfv or taf, conferring partial protection that persists for at least three days. these findings highlight a previously un-recognized role of the mucosal environment in protection against hiv acquisition by modulating availability of arvs to hiv-target cells.previous studies using purified cells from the frt to measure intracellular tfv-dp following incubation with tfv demonstrated that epithelial cells and fibroblast tfv-dp concentrations were 100- and 10-fold higher respectively than those found in cd4+ t cells24. these findings prompted us to ask whether epithelial cells and fibroblast accumulation of arvs extends protection by acting as a reservoir, or compromises it by reducing drug availability to hiv target cells in the frt. a major finding in the present study is that by gradually releasing tfv and taf at concentrations sufficient to provide protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection, epithelial cells and fibroblasts extend arv-mediated protection by providing a reservoir that lengthens the effectiveness of tfv and taf beyond their initial application. recognizing that arvs can be administered orally or locally in the frt, other studies have reported that the route of administration (oral vs. vaginal) influences the time needed for tfv to reach protective levels within hiv-target cells31. following a single oral dose of tfv, the concentration of tfv and tfv-dp in the gastrointestinal (gi) mucosa is 100-fold greater than the frt, and requires 7–14 days to reach a protective concentration in the frt32. a possible reason for this delay could be that orally administered arvs must gi cross the mucosa prior to entering circulation. our studies indicating that tfv accumulates in frt epithelial cells and fibroblasts, suggest that if a comparable concentration occurs in the gi tract cells, it may delay arv levels reaching effective concentrations in the frt. this is particularly relevant for taf which was undetectable in most frt tissues following a single oral dose, while still being detectable in circulation42. however, by acting as a local arv reservoir, gi epithelial cells would also extend arv protection for gi cd4+ t cells, which are susceptible to hiv infection. whether frt epithelial cells, and those from other mucosal sites, can act as a reservoir for other arvs being considered for prep, such as dapivirine, remains to be determined, but could be an important factor in modulating their efficacy.an important finding is that arvs released by epithelial cells can be taken up and re-released by underlying fibroblasts. this suggests that in vivo, epithelial cells and fibroblasts work in tandem, with each contributing to a sustained tissue concentration that provides extended protection of hiv target cells. although we did not measure the concentrations of tfv or taf being released, based on our previous in vitro studies8, we know that the concentrations of tfv and taf that result in partial protection of activated blood cd4+ t cells, as seen in this study, are very low (1–5 μm and 5–10 nm for tfv and taf respectively) and several logs below the detectable limits for measuring tfv and taf7,24. moreover, apical concentrations were below these concentrations (1–5 μm and 5–10 nm for tfv and taf respectively), since we repeatedly found no evidence of protection. however, in vivo, tissue protection may be greater than predicted in our in vitro studies, because of the limited fluid volume within the interstitial space of the frt, where concentrations of arvs would be expected to be several folds higher than in our system. this conclusion  is based on recent findings demonstrating that, whereas the stroma was thought to be dense connective tissue, the interstitium at mucosal sites is now recognized as a series of fluid-filled compartments43. given the partial protection we observe with cm, we speculate that protection in vivo would be more complete, given the reduced interstitial volume and consequently higher concentration of secreted arvs. further studies are needed to obtain a more accurate profile of in vivo intracellular and interstitial concentrations of arvs in frt tissues, recognizing that even within the same tissue, drug distribution, and therefore efficacy, is likely to vary with cell type.an unexpected finding in our study was that whereas basolateral secretions from tfv and taf treated epithelial cells reduced hiv infection of cd4+ t cells, apical secretions from the same cells had no effect. the reasons for this unique phenotype are unclear but previous studies have shown that frt epithelial cells can selectively secrete cytokines and chemokines via their apical or basolateral membranes35,44,45. to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for basolateral release, we examined the expression of mrps, which eliminate drugs from the cells, and found that frt epithelial cells express mrp 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. chemical inhibition of mrp function resulted in a moderate but significant increase in intracellular tfv-dp levels in epithelial cells, and a decrease in cd4+ t cell protection by basolateral secretions from both taf and tfv pre-loaded epithelial cells. these findings are consistent with increased tfv and taf accumulation inside of epithelial cells when transporters are inhibited and suggest that mrps are selectively expressed on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells40. however, since protection was only partially reduced, this raises questions about the extent to which other transporters may also be involved in tfv and taf efflux, since different families of transporters have been described in frt cells, including bcrp and p-gp27. another potential explanation for the partial effect seen in these studies is that initial levels of tfv and taf in epithelial cells following preloading diffuse out and mask transporter function as arvs exit the cell (fig. 6). alternatively, since mrps are a family of anionic transporters46, some of these transporters may be insensitive to the inhibitor used in our studies. additional mechanisms that mediate the selective transport of tfv from frt epithelial cells remain to be elucidated.figure 6proposed pathway of tfv and taf mediated protection of cd4+ t cells by epithelial cells and fibroblasts in the female reproductive tract. tfv and taf readily enter epithelial cells throughout the female reproductive tract (frt) where they are converted to tfv-dp, the active metabolite that inhibits hiv replication. intracellular tfv-dp can be converted back into tfv. while movement of tfv-dp out of the cell is restricted, tfv and taf are released basolaterally into the extracellular environment both by diffusion across the plasma membrane and/or active transport out of cells by mrps expressed on the cell surface. once released to the underlying stroma, tfv/taf either act directly on cd4+ t cells to prevent hiv infection or are taken up by stromal fibroblasts, which similar to epithelial cells, gradually release tfv/taf to the local environment. in doing so, both epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts function as reservoirs that extend the time interval of protection beyond the initial uptake of tfv/taf by mucosal cd4+ t cells, the primary targets of hiv infection.full size imagean interesting finding in our study was that tfv and taf were differentially taken up by epithelial cells when loaded apically (fig. 2f). previous studies have demonstrated that the organic anion transporter (oat) proteins oat1 and 3 are capable of transporting tenofovir into the cells lining the kidney proximal tubule20,47. other studies also demonstrated that endothelial cells express oat1 and oat3 receptors, however, we and others have previously measured these receptors and failed to detect their presence in primary epithelial cells and fibroblasts from throughout the frt18,36. therefore, additional transporters other than oat1 and oat3 may be involved in the differential apical uptake between tfv and taf. others have demonstrated that tfv uptake was partially mediated through endocytosis in vaginal epithelial cell lines and t cells, while tfv disoproxil fumarate entered these cells by passive diffusion18. whether this same mechanism may explain the difference in apical uptake between tfv and taf by primary epithelial cells throughout the frt remains to be determined. further studies are needed to identify potential additional transporters and establish their role in the sustained hiv protection we report in this paper.our findings of preferential basolateral release of arvs have important clinical implications. first, as shown by others48, when administered intravaginally to women, tfv in cervical vaginal lavages (cvl) decreases by 10–100 fold within 24 hr. when women have sex during this time, tfv concentrations further decrease in the vaginal lumen. these findings further support our conclusion  that epithelial cells and fibroblasts serve as important sources of arvs that are gradually released into underlying tissues to provide protection over a period of days. second, it implies that tfv concentrations in cvl following topical or oral administration of tfv and taf are not a good indicator of tissue concentrations and protection, and should not be used to monitor adherence or anti-hiv activity in clinical trials. third, our findings offer another potential explanation for why tfv did not protect women with genital inflammation derived from stis49, which probably increases target cell presence in the mucosa, and induces epithelial injury in the form of crypt abscesses, mucosal erosions and ulceration. under these conditions immune cells would not be protected once the initial drug dose is washed out. given our results, different factors that alter tfv-dp concentrations in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, such as inflammation49, sex hormones such as estradiol which is known to increase uterine epithelial cell intracellular tfv-dp concentrations24, or menopause which lowers concentrations29,50, may be more relevant for protection than previously anticipated.beyond dosage, the efficacy of an arv is modulated by several factors including local inflammation, use of contraceptives, composition of the microbiome, and presence of sexually-transmitted infections8,51,52,53. our previous studies have demonstrated that medroxyprogesterone acetate (mpa), a commonly used contraceptive in sub-saharan africa associated with increased risk of hiv acquisition, inhibits the conversion of tfv to tfv-dp in activated blood cd4+ t cells at concentrations similar to that used in this study, thus leading to decreased protection against hiv infection8. similarly, mpa inhibits conversion of taf to tfv-dp in frt cd4+ t cells8. alterations in the vaginal microbiome are also linked to decreased arv efficacy. anaerobic bacteria such as gardnerella vaginalis commonly seen in bacterial vaginosis, decreased the pool of vaginal tfv available for hiv target cells faster than lactobacillus species51. lastly inflammation, either due to the composition of vaginal gels54 or pre-existing sexually-transmitted infections53, can drive the recruitment of target cells to the mucosal surface bringing them into proximity of incoming hiv, which in turn can undermine the effectiveness of tfv49. our studies add an additional component to the complexity of interactions that dictate arv effectiveness. our results of preferential basolateral release of arvs suggest that tfv or taf treatment would not protect against hiv infection events happening on the mucosal surface, induce under conditions of inflammation or stis that attract target cells to the surface.while there is evidence that tfv is released basolaterally by intestinal (caco-2) and endometrial (hec-1-a) epithelial cell lines, and that tfv is present in ex vivo treated tissue explants55, our study is novel in several aspects. first, ours is the first study to demonstrate that primary epithelial cells throughout the frt accumulate tfv-dp inside the cells and, after the initial drug inoculum is cleared, gradually release tfv, and release it in sufficient amounts and in a sustained manner to protect cd4+ t cells from hiv infection. second, we demonstrate for the first time that the same is true for taf, and that the same effect can be achieved with much lower doses than tfv. third, while previous studies have demonstrated the presence of tfv in the basolateral compartment, to the best of our knowledge, no formal comparison of basolateral and apical release has been performed until now. lastly, our findings are unique in that they demonstrate the release of arvs (tfv and taf) by both columnar (em, cx) and squamous (ecx) ec and underlying stromal fibroblasts from each of these sites.as seen in our summary (fig. 6), on entering cells tfv is converted to tfv-dp, its biologically active form, which is restricted to the intracellular environment on immune and non-immune cells7,8,24. similarly, taf enters cells and is sequentially converted to tfv, and then to tfv-dp20. as a part of this metabolic cycle, tfv-dp from tfv and taf is converted back into tfv, which either leaves the cell or is metabolized to adenosine20. our studies suggest that following washout, two distinct steps (diffusion and transport) regulate the efflux of tfv and possibly taf and are involved in the protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection. we speculate that basolateral protection following arv washout, is due to the gradual release of tfv and taf that is retained inside the epithelial cells and fibroblasts as well as tfv-dp and tfv-mp until converted back to tfv. upon efflux and uptake by cd4+ t cells, tfv is converted back to tfv-dp which exerts a protective effect by inhibiting viral replication. the gradual conversion of tfv-dp and release of tfv from epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts steadily decreases over days following washout, and thus the protective effect against hiv infection also decreases. also shown is the transfer of tfv from epithelial cells to stromal fibroblasts and the fibroblasts ability to gradually release tfv to protect cd4+ t cells from hiv infection. further studies are needed to more fully define the mechanisms whereby epithelial cells and fibroblasts throughout the female reproductive tract function as reservoirs to extend protection of cd4+ t cells beyond the initial arv tissue exposure.in conclusion , our results demonstrate that epithelial cells and underlying stromal fibroblasts from throughout the frt readily take up tfv and taf and produce tfv-dp. after initial drug exposure, degradation of tfv-dp back to tfv as well as any residual tfv and taf can be gradually released to confer protection of cd4+ t cells from hiv infection for several days. our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of the mucosal environment in controlling arv-mediated protection against hiv acquisition and suggest that factors that modify retention of arvs, and intracellular concentrations of their active metabolites, such as tfv-dp, in epithelial cells and fibroblasts may be more relevant for protection than previously anticipated.

Longitudinal HIV sequencing reveals reservoir expression leading to decay which is obscured by clonal expansion,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08431-7,Research,13 February 2019,yes,"after initiating antiretroviral therapy (art), a rapid decline in hiv viral load is followed by a long period of undetectable viremia. viral outgrowth assay suggests the reservoir continues to decline slowly. here, we use full-length sequencing to longitudinally study the proviral landscape of four subjects on art to investigate the selective pressures influencing the dynamics of the treatment-resistant hiv reservoir. we find intact and defective proviruses that contain genetic elements favoring efficient protein expression decrease over time. moreover, proviruses that lack these genetic elements, yet contain strong donor splice sequences, increase relatively to other defective proviruses, especially among clones. our work suggests that hiv expression occurs to a significant extent during art and results in hiv clearance, but this is obscured by the expansion of proviral clones. paradoxically, clonal expansion may also be enhanced by hiv expression that leads to splicing between hiv donor splice sites and downstream human exons.
introduction the advent of antiretroviral therapy (art) revealed a treatment-resistant reservoir of hiv proviruses requiring life-long therapy1. pioneering work has shown that the hiv reservoir has a very slow rate of decay. estimates of reservoir decay suggested a half-life of 44 months using quantitative viral outgrowth assay (qvoa)1,2. however, these measurements were indirect, and their error was sufficiently large that the precise half-life of the reservoir in individual subjects was uncertain. differentiating error due to assay inconsistency versus biological variation is difficult. if biological variation is prominent, a subset of subjects may have significant reservoir decline while others may not. for this reason, it becomes essential to robustly measure each individual’s reservoir decay rate, especially in cure studies. this biological variation could arise for multiple reasons, including variable art compliance or biological differences in the host or pathogen.viral nucleic acid measurements have been used as a surrogate for hiv reservoir size, as some measures have shown significant correlations with qvoa3. longitudinal studies suggest hiv dna is relatively stable after the first few years of art4. however, hiv dna measurements suffer from the presence of defective proviruses, which constitute the majority of the total dna; thus, while the intra-assay variation for pcr is small, the variable and largely unknown frequency of defective proviruses5,6,7,8,9 results in precise but inaccurate estimates of replication-competent reservoir size. as a consequence, large changes in replication-competent proviruses may be masked by defective proviral dna. moreover, selective pressures on defective dna may be different than selective pressures on intact proviruses10, and thus hiv dna measures may not be an appropriate way to longitudinally monitor reservoir dynamics.monitoring the frequency of individual proviral sequences over time in the presence of art could reveal positive and negative selective pressures that act on infected cells. furthermore, such an approach would differentiate between replication-competent and defective proviruses, allowing for a direct calculation of decay of the replication-competent reservoir. while such an approach is currently not feasible for all hiv-infected individuals due to limited throughput and cost, in-depth study of a subset of subjects might provide new insights into reservoir dynamics as well as the effect of the host on reservoir persistence.we employed limiting dilution polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by dna sequencing to obtain full-length sequences of integrated hiv proviruses in four subjects on suppressive art over time. we provide evidence that both intact and defective proviruses that contain genetic elements that favor protein expression are under negative selective pressure. interestingly, defective proviruses that lack these genetic elements, but encode a strong donor splice sequence, are under relative positive selective pressure. we also show significant biological variation in reservoir decay in two of these individuals. in this case, clonal expansion represents an important factor contributing to slower decay. an important implication from our analysis is that the replication-competent reservoir of intact proviruses is under more negative selection than defective proviruses, suggesting that the majority of the replication-competent reservoir is expressed over time.resultslongitudinal parameters of four subjects on artwe wanted to assess the decay rate of intact and defective proviruses by combining proviral sequencing with pcr measurements of hiv dna levels. we identified two subjects with detailed clinical histories (supplementary table 1) and sufficient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) aliquots spanning more than a decade after achieving virological suppression. for both subjects, total and integrated hiv dna were assessed at multiple intervals during the first 11–13 years of art (fig. 1 and supplementary tables 1–3). viral load and cd4 t cell count were repeatedly assessed in both subjects over the study period. for subject 1, viral load was always below the detection limit of the diagnostic assay (<50 copies or <20 copies/ml). for subject 2, the majority of viral load measurements were below the detection limit, with a few episodes of low-level viremia detected after 9 years of continuous virological suppression on art (fig. 1). there was a slight decline in total and integrated hiv dna over the study period, in general less than a two-fold change by any measure (i.e. normalized to cd4, pbmc or per unit volume; supplementary tables 2 and 3). in conclusion , rna and dna measurements including total and integrated hiv dna decreased minimally over time, suggesting minimal change in reservoir size. two additional subjects were also included for whom two time points were available (fig. 1 and supplementary tables 1–3).fig. 1longitudinal parameters of four subjects over time on art. longitudinal levels of plasma hiv-1 rna (blue), total hiv dna (green), and cd4 t cell counts (red). for each subject, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were collected by apheresis at the time points indicated in the graph. the arrows identify the time points we used for sequencing of both intact and defective proviruses, while for the remaining time points only near-full-length proviruses were sequenced. asteriks identify the time points used for the deletion maps in fig. 4. total hiv dna was quantified by primers binding to the long terminal repeat region of hiv-1. values are normalized to cd4 t cell count and presented as log copies of hiv per million cd4 t cells. hiv rna is presented as copies per ml bloodfull size imagedynamic changes of intact proviruses imply hiv expressionto estimate the decay rate of the hiv reservoir, we performed limiting dilution full-length pcr at multiple time points in subjects 1 and 2 followed by proviral sequencing of the full-length amplicons to determine if they were intact. our criteria for an intact provirus were the presence of nine open reading frames (orfs) and 3–4 stem loops at the psi packaging site as well as several critical donor and acceptor splice sequences11,12,13 and the rev-responsive element (rre) sequence14, as detailed in the methods section. when we plotted the frequency of intact proviruses over time, we noticed substantial decay (fig. 2a, b), in contrast to total hiv dna, which was relatively constant over the same time frame (fig. 1). for subject 1, we found the exponential decay rate was −0.38/year with a half-life of 1.8 years. for the purpose of modeling, time 0 was the moment the subject was placed on art. using the best-fit exponential decay curve, we predicted that subject 1 had an estimated 734 intact proviruses per million cd4 t cells contributing to his reservoir at the time he was placed on art. after 11 years of art, we estimated that 98% of the cells with intact proviruses were cleared (fig. 2a). subject 2 had a slower decay rate (−0.2/year) with a half-life of 3.4 years, and after 11 years the number of intact proviruses declined from an estimated 1490 to 158 per million cd4 t cells (fig. 2b). this slower decay of intact proviruses in subject 2 may be due to multiple reasons, including clonal expansion, ongoing replication15, and redistribution of infected cells from lymphoid tissue.fig. 2dynamic changes of intact proviruses over time. a

concentration of total hiv dna per cd4 by the frequency of sequenced proviruses that were intact. b frequency of intact proviruses for subject 2. c frequency of intact proviruses for subject 1 when counting clones only the first time they were detected in order to minimize the effects of clonal expansion. d frequency of intact proviruses in subject 2 with clones counted only once, when they first appeared. we included five time points for subject 1 and 7 for subject 2. for subject 1, we did not identify any intact provirus in 2018, and therefore this time point is presented as an open circle. black bars signify 95 percent confidence interval of the mean based on a binomial process with approximately 100 sequences per time point. the blue line is the estimated decay based on a exponential decay modelfull size imageto investigate the role of clonal expansion in proviral decay over time, we aligned intact proviruses and generated a phylogenetic tree for subjects 1 and 2 independently (fig. 3a, b). we noticed that there was no increase in sequence diversity over time, consistent with no replication16,17,18,19,20 or minimal replication21,22,23,24,25 on art. we identified several identical sequences in the intact tree, suggesting clonal expansion of intact proviruses6,9,26,27,28,29,30,31,32. for subject 1, there were occasional identical intact clones, but they did not appear to increase in frequency over time. there was one pair of identical sequences in 2008, and another distinct pair was identified in 2012 which was also detected once in 2015. while identical sequences only accounted for ~22% of intact proviruses in subject 1, in 2015 half of the intact proviruses (1 out of 2) had been sampled at earlier time points. we found no intact proviruses in the 2018 sample from subject 1 (fig. 3a). for subject 2, we identified nine distinct clones of intact proviruses which increased in prevalence over time. one identical clone emerged ~9 years after starting art (2014) in subject 2 and persisted in samples from 2015 and 2018. this proviral clone was capable of releasing infectious virus as measured by qvoa (fig. 3b). the presence of identical sequences is suggestive of clonal expansion of cells harboring intact proviruses, a recently supported phenomenon6,9,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 which may contribute significantly to the maintenance of the intact reservoir. to minimize the effect of clonal expansion on reservoir decay, we next counted each clone only once, at the time it first appeared (fig. 2c, d), assuming proviruses with identical sequences were clones. we found that this led to a greater fit to the exponential model, suggesting that when the effects of clonal expansion are reduced the resulting dynamics more closely follow an exponential decay. given the substantial decay of intact proviruses when clonal expansion is minimized, our data suggest that a significant portion of the reservoir is expressed over time, consistent with recent literature33,34,35 as well as intracellular rna measures in both subjects (supplementary table 2).fig. 3phylogenetic tree of intact proviruses for subjects 1 and 2. a phylogenetic tree of

proviral decay79. for subject 1, no intact proviruses were identified in the sample from 2018, and therefore this time point is presented as an open circlefull size imagerole of splicing on the proviral landscapeour results of minimal changes in hiv dna yet a significant decline in intact proviruses over time led us to investigate the dynamics of defective proviruses in the reservoir. importantly, defective proviruses are not expected to be subject to selective pressures that arise through ongoing replication. we restricted our study to four similar time points for subjects 1 and 2, spanning nearly 10 years on art and 2 time points for subjects 3 and 4 (identified by arrows in fig. 1). we performed full-length proviral sequencing of every amplicon obtained at limiting dilution. in this way, we sequenced over 1400 individual proviruses and performed de novo assembly to generate contiguous sequences. evaluation of the de novo assembled proviruses showed a predominance of large deletions, in agreement with other studies5,6,7,8,9,10. supplementary figure 1 shows the distribution of the sequenced proviruses according to the number of orfs. we observed that proviruses with nine complete orfs tended to contract over time while proviruses with 0 orfs did not. a detailed analysis of orf selection showed that proviruses with an intact hiv gag orf were negatively selected, but no other clear pattern emerged (fig. 4). initially, this seemed counterintuitive since gag is less toxic than other hiv proteins. this led us to examine the deletion maps of the subjects which revealed that splicing could play an important role in selection.fig. 4deletion analysis reveals a role for splicing in reservoir dynamics. a defective proviruses from an apheresis sample collected from subject 1 in 2008 (~1 year of art) are aligned to hxb2. in order, from top to bottom, black proviruses are d1+ d4+, red proviruses are d1+ d4−, blue proviruses are d1− d4+, and gold proviruses are d1−d4-. hypermutated proviruses are represented in purple. the shaded beige, light green, and dark green regions correspond to the gag, gag-pol, and pol regions of hxb2, respectively. on the left side of panels a–h we show the percentage of defective proviruses containing a complete gag orf. b defective proviruses from subject 1 for the apheresis sample collected in 2015 (~8 years of art). proviruses are graphed on the same scale to demonstrate how the proportion of each type of defective proviruses changed from first to last time point. c, d defective proviruses from subject 2 for the apheresis sample collected in 2007 (~2 years of art) and in 2014 (~9 years of art). e, f defective proviruses from subject 3 for the apheresis sample collected in 2001 (~4 years of art) and in 2005 (~9 years of art). g, h defective proviruses from subject 4 for the apheresis sample collected in 2010 (~2 years of art) and in 2014 (~7 years of art). the time points used for the deletion maps are identified by asterisks in fig. 1. the first black provirus depicted in a contains a d1 and terminates within the gag orf, but this is obscured due to imperfect r-coded filteringfull size imageto visually inspect for selection pressures that might be exerted on deleted proviruses, we first aligned all defective proviruses from two time points for subject 1 (fig. 4a, b) and subject 2 (fig. 4c, d) identified by asterisk in fig. 1 as well as subjects 3 (fig. 4e, f) and 4 (fig. 4g, h) to the reference hxb2. next, we grouped the deleted proviruses into categories based on the presence or absence of the donor splice sites 1 (d1) and 4 (d4). d1 and d4 are unique among hiv splice sites for their strong ability to interact with u1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snrnp) and splice with a downstream acceptor. the other splice donor and acceptor sites of hiv are all considered weak12,36. we categorized deleted proviruses as follows: d1+d4+ (black), d1+d4− (red), d1−d4+ (blue), d1−d4− (gold), and hypermutated proviruses (purple). upon inspection, we found that the proportion of d1+d4+ (black) proviruses contracted the most. these proviruses had small deletions but retained d1 and d4. in addition, a subset of the d1+d4− (red) proviruses, which contain 3′ deletions that encompass d4, also appeared to contract over time, especially in subject 1. interestingly, we found that a large fraction of these proviruses had the genetic potential to express hiv gag and occasionally hiv pol (fig. 4a–d). notably, despite the fact that the red proviruses lack the rre, there is evidence that nuclear export of gag can be rev-independent37. thus, we hypothesize that gag transcripts can reach the cytoplasm and be translated even in the absence of rev. the fraction of d1−d4− (gold) and hypermutated (purple) proviruses did not significantly change over time. neither of these proviruses would be expected to express functional hiv proteins. overall, it seems the potential to express hiv proteins exerts a negative selection pressure on the hiv proviral landscape.one category of proviruses increased relatively over time. these proviruses are represented in blue in fig. 4. all blue proviruses contained a deletion in the 5′ end and are missing the major splice donor site d1, but they all preserved d4 (d1−d4+). on inspection, it became clear that at the later time points several of the blue proviruses were identical sequences and represented defective proviral clones. these proviruses are not expected to express hiv gag/pol efficiently because they lack the canonical aug for gag/pol. for this category of defective proviruses, the deletion begins in front of the four stem loops of the psi packaging site and ends before d4. this is true by definition because d1 is located within the second stem loop of the packaging site. importantly, d1 is utilized in the canonical splice pathway for all the proteins besides gag/pol which are encoded on the 3′ end of hiv. given that all canonical spliced and unspliced forms of hiv have by design the same 5′ untranslated region (5′utr) with extensive secondary structure, including the trans-activation response element (tar) and the four packaging stem loops38, it is reasonable to assume that hiv has evolved to efficiently translate proteins when the entire 5′utr is placed next to the favored aug. it follows that truncating the 5′utr would likely make hiv translation less efficient. thus, inefficient protein expression may provide one mechanism for the relative increase over time of d1−d4+ proviruses. importantly, we observed similar patterns in two additional subjects for which only two time points were available for analysis (fig. 4e–h).immune evasion may also contribute to the relative preservation of d1−d4+ proviruses. all of the d1−d4+ proviruses also contain a complete orf for nef, which could provide a mechanism of immune evasion39,40,41,42,43. nef has been shown to downregulate mhc and to provide protection from ctl clearance39,40,41,42,43. these changes, while still present in subject 2, tended to be less dramatic as compared to the other subjects. this could be due to weaker immune responses in subject 2, which in turn would be consistent with his clinical history, characterized by hla b35 haplotype and a rapid drop in cd4 t cell count [down to 0 cd4 t cells six years after diagnosis (supplementary table 1)]. thus, d1−d4+ proviral clones may be relatively preserved because they evade the immune system by nef.two opposing forces shape the proviral landscapeto probe if expression potential was important for selective pressure we investigated whether defective proviruses with an intact d1 sequence and at least one intact orf were selected against and thus declined over time. we required the presence of d1 and at least one intact orf because proteins that are expressed on the 3′end utilize this sequence to make the canonical spliced products that encode all proteins except gag/pol12,13. the majority of proviruses meeting these criteria contained an intact gag orf (fig. 4). we excluded intact proviruses which clearly decreased over time from this analysis to concentrate on the pressures exerted on defective proviruses. by using a linear random-effects regression model, we found a relative decline in defective proviruses with a d1 splice site and at least one intact orf in the four subjects (p = 0.003 by type iii anova; fig. 5a). thus, our data suggest that the potential to express proteins even among defective proviruses correlates with relative clearance of proviral dna.fig. 5relative changes in the major splice sites donors reveal selection pressures. a percentage of defective proviruses with d1 splice site and at least one orf

over time in defective proviruses (black). estimations of a common slope for these data were done using a linear random-effects regression model, assuming each subject had a different intercept at the initiation of art. to test for the statistical significance of this effect, a statistical analysis based on a type iii anova was performed. the time points used for the analysis of the deleted proviruses are identified by arrows in fig. 1full size imagewe next asked if the presence of a strong d4 in the absence of d1 could explain the relative increase of defective proviruses containing complete orfs in the 3′end over time. we reasoned that the absence of d1 in a provirus with a large 5′ deletion would truncate the 5′utr and thereby hinder expression of any of the hiv proteins translated from spliced rnas12,13. moreover, the vast majority of d1−d4+ proviruses contain an intact orf for nef such that if proteins were made, we would expect nef to be prominent among them. given that nef provides a mechanism for immune evasion39,40,41,42,43 this might contribute to positive selection. to test this hypothesis, we plotted the presence of d4 without d1 over time among defective proviruses in the four subjects and found a significant increase (p = 0.05 by type iii anova), consistent with relative positive selection for proviruses with strong donor splice sites without strong potential for hiv protein expression (fig. 5b).we then asked if the presence of a strong donor splice site (d1 or d4) might drive the relative increase in deleted proviruses when genetic elements that favor protein expression are missing, potentially by enhancing clonal expansion. we defined those proviruses that lack genetic elements to promote protein expression (d1−d4+ and d1+ without orfs) as proviruses with an unopposed strong donor splice site. in other words, the term unopposed indicates proviruses without genetic elements that favor protein expression. we found a correlation between the percentage of unopposed splice sites and time (p < 0.001 by type iii anova; fig. 5c). in summary, the number of defective proviruses that contained unopposed strong donor splice sites increased over time which likely reflects proliferation of cells containing these defective proviruses.we next plotted the frequency of all clones over time as a proportion of the reservoir. in all subjects we observed the expansion of proviral clones over time (p = 0.05 by type iii anova; fig. 5d). clones steadily increased relative to other defective proviruses over time, consistent with several recent studies29,30,31,44,45. splicing may be one driver of clonal expansion since a higher percentage of clones contained unopposed splice sites than defective proviruses in general (supplementary table 4, p = 0.02 by wilcoxon signed-rank test). notably, the absolute number of defective proviruses with unopposed splicing potential as well as clones did not change over time on art (supplementary fig. 2). this suggests that the majority of clonal expansion occurs before or near the time of art initiation (supplementary fig. 2). nonetheless, our data are consistent with other studies32 showing that individual proviral clones wax and wane during art, indicating that clonal expansion continues even after art initiation, possibly at a slower rate (supplementary fig. 3).hiv expression can lead to aberrant splicingin order to investigate the biological evidence supporting our findings, we measured the frequency of cells that contained unspliced hiv rna and multispliced (ms) hiv rna in subjects 1 and 2 (supplementary table 2). we found between 10% and 30% of proviruses were actively transcribing at the four time points tested consistent with33,34. a much smaller fraction of cells had detectable tat/rev ms hiv rna. thus, the potential to splice to downstream oncogenes exists. we then measured the frequency of splicing between d1 or d4 and downstream human genes in our in vitro model of resting t cell infection. in a recent study46, d1 was shown to splice to the human oncogene stat5b, suggesting a potential mechanism that hiv can exploit for its own expansion by integrating into genes that promote cell division. this finding as well as our own results led us to investigate whether d1 or d4 could splice to downstream exons in infected cd4 t cells. we first performed rt-pcr on 600 ng rna recovered from in vitro-infected cd4 t cells. after two rounds of pcr, we were able to detect and confirm by sanger sequencing the presence of d4-stat5b chimeric transcripts (fig. 6), but not d1-stat5b transcripts. we then performed rna-seq on four million in vitro-infected cd4 t cells that were cultured for 7 days in the presence of il-7 and found that splicing occurred more frequently between d4 and downstream exons in comparison to d1 (20 to 1 ratio; fig. 6). while our experiment does not address selection, our data are consistent with the idea that splicing between d4 and downstream exons could provide a mechanism to induce cell division. in turn, this may explain why d1−d4+ proviruses are enriched relative to other proviruses over time.fig. 6hiv expression leads to chimeric transcripts between d1 or d4 and human genes. rna-seq was performed using in vitro-infected resting cells harvested at day 7 after infection. the sequences of the chimeric transcripts between hiv d1 (blue) and human genes (black) are shown in the top panel, while those between hiv d4 (red) and human genes (black) are shown in the bottom panel. we marked in green the sequences we could not map to either hiv or the human genome.the sequence marked with an asterisk was retrieved by rt-pcr and sanger sequencing of in vitro-infected cd4 t cellsfull size imagediscussion our longitudinal study of proviral sequences reveals that two opposing forces simultaneously exert negative and relative positive selection pressures on cells containing proviral dna in hiv-infected individuals on art. specifically, we found that proviruses with both an intact 5′utr and orfs declined over time while proviruses with strong donor splice sites and a truncated 5′utr increased relatively over time. consistent with recent studies6,9,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, we also found evidence of clonal expansion of intact proviruses. we speculate that positive selection of these proviruses can be driven by the unique positioning of strong hiv donor splice sites within an intron of an oncogene. our work has several implications for hiv eradication: first, it provides a mechanism for how intact proviruses can decline over time while proviral dna levels remain unchanged; second, it gives new insights on forces that might drive clonal expansion; third, it provocatively suggests that the hiv reservoir is likely less resistant to reactivation than generally thought. this has important implications for hiv cure as it suggests that the major hurdle to hiv eradication may not be the invisibility of the reservoir. on the contrary, our results suggest that hiv expression may provide a targetable mechanism for hiv persistence.we find reservoir expression leads to proviral clearance. our data show that intact proviruses contracted more rapidly than defective proviruses. this finding suggests that intact proviruses experience stronger negative selection. the strong negative pressure against intact proviruses suggests in turn that the majority of the replication-competent reservoir is expressed over time, despite the small fraction that is detectably expressed at any one moment33,34,35,47,48,49,50. negative selective pressures could be due to immune or viral cytotoxicity. it is generally thought that immune pressure during art is minimal due to the dramatic drop in the total antigen load51,52,53. however, our study suggests that immune pressure can play a role in shaping the reservoir even during suppressive art in humans. in rhesus macaques there is evidence that cd8 t cell depletion after art suppression results in rebound viremia, which is consistent with our interpretation54.deleted proviruses with genetic elements that promote protein expression contract over time. in addition to intact proviruses, we observed the contraction over time of a subset of defective proviruses. we noticed this subset contained both a full-length 5′utr and at least one functional orf and fell into the category of d1+ d4+ or d1+ d4−. the 5′utr is generally defined as the region between the transcription start site and the canonical aug start codon. this region contains several regulatory elements that play a role in translation initiation38. subject 2 showed a weaker contraction of proviruses with a full-length 5′utr and gag orf. this suggests that subject 2 exerts less immune pressure than the other subjects, as supported by clinical history of more rapid progression (supplementary table 1). the variable contraction of proviruses on art could be due to variable immune pressure. consistent with this idea, proviral dna significantly declines on art in elite controllers and acutely infected individuals, who have a more robust immune response to hiv55,56,57,58,59,60,61. on the other hand, proviral dna decline is variable and difficult to detect in chronically infected individuals who have a weaker immune system59,60,61.proviruses with limited expression potential are relatively preserved over time. it seems reasonable to assume that cells infected with proviruses that lack orfs will experience no immune pressure and those that have reduced genetic potential for protein expression would be relatively preserved because they would be less visible to the immune system. specifically, d1−d4+ proviruses should also be relatively protected from immune clearance as we expect them to be expressed at lower levels since they have a truncated 5′utr. interestingly, the d1−d4+ proviruses have deletions that start in front of the hiv packaging site stem loops (downstream of tar) and end somewhere in gag/pol. while a role for tar in translation has been supported38, further work on the stem loops is needed to demonstrate if they have a role in translational control of hiv62. it should also be mentioned that immune evasion provides an additional (not mutually exclusive) mechanism for d1−d4+ preservation. the vast majority of d1−d4+ proviruses contain hiv nef, which may contribute to immune evasion39,40,41,42,43,63.proviruses that lack elements to promote protein expression but retain splicing may enhance clonal expansion. our data in combination with recent work45,46,64 suggest that integration of proviruses into introns can stimulate cell division. long terminal repeat (ltr) transcription can lead to splicing between a strong hiv donor site and an oncogene acceptor site. this in turn could result in higher expression of the oncogene as recently described46. our work advances the findings of cesana et al.46 by showing that unopposed strong donor splice sequences correlate with relative proviral clonal expansion in vivo and by demonstrating the contribution of d4, not just d1 (figs. 4–6, supplementary fig. 2, supplementary table 4). our hypothesis is further supported by the presence of chimeric transcripts between hiv and human genes (fig. 6). in the context of recent literature, splicing in the absence of immune clearance provides a mechanism for how hiv integration near an oncogene can lead to clonal expansion45,46,65,64.contraction and expansion forces could be applied to all proviral clones including intact ones. notably, if hiv inserts within an intron of an oncogene it seems likely that with robust ltr transcription there could a mixture of canonical hiv rna forms leading to hiv protein expression and aberrant splicing to downstream exons. cell division would occur if a strong d1 or d4 splice sequence spliced to an exon of an oncogene, leading to forced expression of the oncogene. on the other hand, negative selection pressure may occur if the provirus expresses hiv proteins that could lead to immune-mediated or viral cytotoxicity. in other words, a d1+ d4− provirus could express proteins and also provide a d1 to splice to an oncogene. in fact, this could apply to all categories of proviruses that have the potential to express hiv proteins as well as splice, including the intact ones. notably, intact proviral clones appear to emerge after many years of art when the immune system wanes. it seems logical that intact proviral clones would proliferate without being cleared by the waning immune system. if true, this would suggest that immune clearance plays a greater role than viral cytotoxicity in the elimination of proviral clones.the timing and drivers of clonal expansion remain unclear. one limitation of our approach is that we cannot easily quantify the extent of negative and positive selection individually because they are opposing and simultaneous forces. it is possible that clones form predominantly before starting art or around the time of art initiation, then emerge after clearance of the proviruses capable of expressing proteins. this is consistent with previous work showing turnover of t cells is many fold higher before art is initiated66. it is also consistent with our own work that shows a steady increase in proviral dna over time prior to art59 which then plateaus after art initiation4,59. on the other hand, our data show that individual proviral clones wax and wane over time (supplementary figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that clonal expansion likely occurs even during art, perhaps at a lower rate, perhaps driven by sporadic stimuli. regardless, the enrichment of clones with identical sequences indicates that some proviral expansion occurs through cell division and likely includes episodic expansions and contractions. our contribution is to provide evidence that a substantial driving force may be due to unique positioning of splicing sites, but several other drivers beyond splicing likely play a role67.clonal expansion is a newly identified force driving hiv persistence. in our study, we observed that 78% of intact proviruses in subject 2 were identical at the last time point. this suggests that cell division contributed to the increase in intact proviruses in subject 2. previous investigations have shown that hiv preferentially integrates into actively transcribing genes68 and can potentially clonally expand without reactivating and triggering immune clearance69. evidence supporting a role for clonal expansion in proviral persistence has been mounting6,9,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,44,45,46,64,67,70,71. in one study, the identical intact sequences were more prominent in effector memory (em) cells6 consistent with work showing the persistence over many years of a mutant hiv clone in em cells72. another study showed that clonally expanded proviruses are important for viral rebound33. the accumulation of intact clonal sequences (fig. 3) in subject 2 adds to the evidence that clonal expansion plays a role in reservoir persistence and suggests that its contribution is substantial.an important limitation of our study is the small number of subjects studied as well as the fact that our analysis is comprised of only the circulating white blood cells. thus, our data do not reflect the selection of proviruses in tissue-resident lymphocytes that do not recirculate. however, as recent studies have shown that the phylogeny of proviruses isolated from lymph nodes and blood is similar, our analysis likely reflects selection pressures exerted on the circulating pool of lymphocytes that travel between the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes33,34. moreover, we cannot rule out that some rounds of ongoing replication (either due to poor art penetration into some compartments or drug resistance) may have occurred, especially in subject 2. however, the lack of phylogenetic evidence of ongoing replication and the demonstration that the predominant intact sequences are predicted to be susceptible to art, combined with the prevalence of clonal expansion, reinforce the notion that cellular expansion, not viral replication, is likely the primary driver of positive selection in individuals on art.taken together, our data suggest that intact hiv proviruses are under stronger negative selective pressure for clearance than defective proviruses. this suggests indirectly that the majority of the reservoir is expressed over several years, implying that lack of hiv expression may not be the main hurdle to reservoir clearance. in fact, the very expression of hiv rna may play an important role in hiv persistence as rna transcription is essential for hiv splicing. splicing in turn may enhance expression of downstream genes involved in cell division and may represent a new target for hiv cure.methodsapheresissubjects underwent apheresis at the university of pennsylvania according to protocols #704904, approved by the institutional review board (irb). each subject signed an informed written consent to be enrolled in the study. the early time point samples from subjects 1 and 2 as well as the samples from subjects 3 and 4 were provided by dr. stephen migueles (national institute of health) who follows his institutional protocol with irb approval.dna isolation and quantification of hiv dnadna was isolated from pbmcs using the gentra puregene cell kit (qiagen). hiv dna was quantified by total hiv against the ltr (primers ltr f and ltr r; table 1) or gag regions (primers gag f and gag r; table 1). integrated hiv dna was measured using primers alu f and gag r; table 1). first-step pcr reactions were cycled using the nexus master cycler (eppendorf) and qpcr reactions were cycled on a 7500 fast real-time instrument (thermofisher). for total hiv, pcr conditions for the first round were: 95 °c for 2 min; then 95 °c for 15 s, 64 °c for 45 s, 72 °c for 1 min for 12 cycles; and then 72 °c for 10 min. for alu-gag measurements the following pcr conditions for the first round were used: 95 °c for 2 min; then 95 °c for 15 s, 56 °c for 45 s, 72 °c for 3:30 min for 40 cycles; and then 72 °c for 10 min. fifteen microliters of the first-round pcr reactions were run on the qpcr instrument using the primers ltr f and ltr r for total hiv ltr and alu-gag reactions and primers gag f and gag r for total hiv gag measurements (table 1). pcr conditions were: 95 °c for 15 s; then 95 °c for 10 s, 60 °c for 20 s for 40 cycles.table 1 list of primers used in the studyfull size tablecell-associated hiv rna measurementsfrequencies of cell-associated hiv rna+ cells per million pbmc and hiv rna copy numbers per cell were measured by limiting dilution-duplex seminested qpcr assay that measures unspliced (us) and multispliced (ms) rna simultaneously in the same rna aliquot73. us rna for both subjects was measured by a gag assay. ms rna for subject 1 was measured by an assay that amplifies exon 1–4 junction, while for subject 2 it was measured by an assay that amplifies exon 4–7 junction. different primers for ms rna were chosen because of primer mismatches. the primers used for these measurements are reported in table 1.provirus amplification and sequencinga two-step nested pcr approach was used to reduce non-specific amplification from genomic targets. primer sets used in both reactions were located within the ltrs and were staggered appropriately to avoid localized ltr amplification as well as ltr-related pcr artifacts while simultaneously capturing nearly the full-length of hiv proviruses (table 1). we used a long-range and high-fidelity polymerase enzyme for both reactions (platinum superfi pcr master mix; thermofisher). in the first pcr reaction, pbmc dna was diluted so that pcr amplification resulted in ≤30% of wells being positive for hiv dna. the following pcr cycling conditions were used for both rounds: 95 °c for 2 min; then 95 °c for 15 s, 68 °c for 8 min (15 cycles for the first pcr, 40 cycles for the second one); then 72 °c for 5 min. nested pcr reactions were visualized by gel electrophoresis, and the fraction of reactions containing ≥2 bands were excluded from our analysis as these were often found to contain multiple proviruses. pcr amplicons were purified using the dna clean & concentrator kit (zymogen) and dna concentration was measured using the quant-it dsdna broad range assay kit (thermofisher). amplicons were prepared using the nextera library preparation kit (illumina) and sequenced on a miniseq system using a mid-output flow cell (illumina).sequence assembly and removal of double provirusespaired reads were trimmed in the program geneious using the bbduk plugin, discarding reads from the adaptor, and then merged using geneious. again, the reads were trimmed of those with a quality rating under 30, and those under 115 base pairs in length. the reads were then mapped using bbmap to the hxb2 reference sequence, and the reads that aligned to the hiv sequence were extracted. provirus contigs were made through de novo assembly of the extracted reads. contigs generated by spades, tadpole, and trinity de novo assemblers were compared. accuracy of each assembler was evaluated by: (1) its ability to produce a contig matching the length of the region supported by reads when mapped to an hiv reference (2) reads supporting the generated contig. we selected spades as our default de novo assembler based on these criteria. reads were de novo assembled using spades with default settings. when reads gave rise to multiple non-overlapping contigs, the contigs were concatenated into one sequence. the final contig was then mapped back to hxb2, and annotated with motifs, including splice donor and acceptor sites, and orfs as described in the supplementary methods 2. finally, in order to determine whether two proviruses had been sequenced together (double proviruses), the extracted reads were aligned to the assembled contig. double proviruses were identified according to the criteria listed in the supplementary methods 1 and discarded from analysis.nomenclatureintact proviruses were defined as those determined to code for nearly complete psi packaging sites with at least three stem loops (sl2 has to be intact because it contains d113) and nine complete orfs for all hiv genes. we allowed for truncated nef and tat genes as commonly identified in infectious strains of hiv74. nef was allowed to be truncated up to the extent seen in nl4-3. we required the presence of major donor site 1 or a gt dinucleotide cryptic donor site located four nucleotides downstream13 (only found in four proviruses) and presence of major donor site 4. we also required the presence of splice acceptor site a5, a7, either a4a or a4b or a4c as well as an intact rre sequence (supplementary table 5)13. we also accepted the sequence ggtaagt as well as the canonical donor 1 splice sequence ggtgagt for the d1 sequence as these sequences binds u1 snrnp equally well75. notably this d1 variant sequence was found in a proviral sequence with no functional orfs that was present at increasing frequency over time, consistent with clonal expansion.intact provirus decay analysisbased on intact criteria, the number of intact proviruses per million cd4 t cells was calculated for each subject at multiple time points. to estimate decay parameters, a statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects regression model assuming first-order decay kinetics. setting time t = 0 to be the date when art was initiated, we were able to estimate the number of intact proviruses at the beginning of treatment, decay rate, as well as their half-life.deletion analysisprovirus consensus sequences were aligned by mafft76 using the iterative e-ins-i method with a gap penalty opening penalty of 1.8. this facilitates proper alignment of proviruses of different lengths, which is common among proviruses with deletions. aligned sequences were then exported to an r software environment using the seqinr biological sequence retrieval and analysis package. once in the r software environment, a program removed base pairs within each subject′s proviruses which were insertions relative to the hxb2 hiv sequence. this allowed the alignment of all proviruses to be standardized in length with base pair indices to hxb2. then, deletions with length more than 100 base pairs were recorded, and a graph was made in r which showed each sequence plotted against the base pair numbers of hxb2, with deletions shown (fig. 4).identification of hypermutant sequencesto identify hypermutant hiv sequences, all proviruses for each individual were aligned using mafft with the e-insi algorithm and a 1.8 gap penalty, and an intact hiv sequence was selected as the reference. the aligned proviruses were checked against the reference for hypermutants using the lanl hypermut 2 program. the provirus with the lowest chance of being a hypermutant as determined by the hypermut program was selected as the reference, and once again hypermut 2 was run on the alignment. proviruses determined to be hypermutant with p < 0.05 were counted as hypermutant ones.phylogenies and identification of potential clonesintact proviral sequences were aligned using mafft76 with the g-insi algorithm with a 1.8 gap penalty. a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using phyml with the general time reversible substitution model, using both spr and nni optimization methods for topology, four substitution rate categories, and an estimated transition/transversion ratio, proportion of invariable sites, and gamma distribution parameter77.as described above, all intact proviruses were aligned in mafft using the e-insi algorithm to find potential clones, defined as proviruses with the same sequence and similar length. we first trimmed the entire 5′ ltr and the 3′ ltr up to the end of nef. this was done to remove any ambiguous nucleotides due to poor assembly at both ends of the proviruses. we then created a phylogeny of the intact proviruses as described above, except those with inversions and large insertions. proviruses that clustered closely in the phylogeny were then individually aligned with each other and manually checked for identical sequences (with sequence differences highlighted by geneious). clones were checked for a second time, this time once again aligning all proviruses with mafft and then among proviruses of a similar length manually identifying proviruses with identical sequences.qvoa assayfor subject 2, we set up a qvoa using pbmcs from 2014 and 2015. total cd4 t cells were negatively selected from pbmcs using the easyseptm human cd4+ t cell isolation kit (stemcell technologies) and cultured at limiting dilutions in rpmi supplemented with 50 u/ml il-2, il-15 superagonist (alt-803; 72 ng/ml; altor), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin–streptomycin, l-glutamine, and pha (2 µg/ml). allogeneic feeder pbmcs from a healthy donor were irradiated and added to culture. molt-4 cells (crl-1582, atcc) were added 24 h later and the cells were cultured for 2 weeks with half media changes every 3–4 days. after 2 weeks, supernatants were screened for p24 using nci fredrick p24 elisa kits. iupms were calculated using extreme limiting dilution analysis software (walter and eliza hall).sequencing of outgrowth virus populationsviral rna was isolated from each p24-positive qvoa well and converted to cdna using an oligo(dt) primer and superscript iii reverse transcriptase (table 1). for each p24-positive qvoa well, a nearly full-length viral genome (~8845 bases in length) was amplified in two segments using barcoded primers that labeled each amplicon with one of 64 different barcodes. amplicons were then separately gel purified using the qiagen minelute gel extraction kit and smartbell adaptors were added to the amplicons using the template prep kit (pacbio). sixty-four amplicons (each with a different barcode) were pooled into a library and libraries were submitted for pacbio sequencing (movie time of 10 h). the resulting sequences were first grouped by barcode, thus allowing identification of the qvoa well from which a virus was derived and correction of sequencing errors. high-quality sequences were then analyzed using the pacbio long amplicon analysis (laa) package. the 5′ and 3′ amplicons for the same virus were joined and visually screened to confirm that orfs were intact.rt-pcr and rna-seqresting cd4 t cells of an uninfected donor were isolated and infected with nl4-3 by spinoculation by centrifuging viral supernatant on cells at 1200g for 2 h at 25 °c78. cells were cultured for 7 days in the presence of il-7 20 ng/ml and sqv 1 µm. at day 7, cells were harvested and total rna was isolated using trizol. rt-pcr was performed with 600 ng rna per reaction, with primers binding to the hiv ltr (primer ltr 2) and stat5b exon 6 (primer stat5b 1) (table 1)46. the enzymes superscript iii and platinum taq polymerase were used for reverse transcription and amplification, respectively. the amplification product was diluted 1:50 and reamplified in two separate reactions with taq polymerase using nested primers. in one reaction, the nested primers from cesana et al.46 were used to further amplify d1-stat5b transcripts (primer ltr 3 and stat5b 2), and in another reaction nested primers were used to amplify d4-stat5b transcripts (primer d4 f and stat5b 3; table 1). to isolate d4-stat5b, we designed our own d4 and stat5b primers (table 1). our nested stat5b primer was in exon 2 of stat5b, closer to the junction between hiv and stat5b observed by cesana et al.46. gel electrophoresis was performed on 30% of the amplification product from each reaction, and a band at the expected length was seen for the d4-stat5b amplicon (210 nt), but not for d1-stat5b. repeat pcr was performed on the remaining d4-stat5b sample to obtain enough sample for sanger sequencing using the same primers. thirty percent of the product of this reaction was run on a gel, and the band was excised, purified, and sanger-sequenced with both the d4 f and stat5b 3 primers. the transcript sequence mapped to hiv up to the d4 splice site, and then mapped to the stat5b gene starting at the same junction at the start of exon 2 as seen by cesana et al.46.for rna-seq, we used 1 µg of rna isolated by trizol from the same in vitro-infected cells. ribosomal rna was removed using the ribo-zero gold rrna removal kit (illumina). the enriched messenger rna was sequenced on a nextseq 500/550 instrument after library preparation using the truseq stranded total rna kit (illumina).statistical analysis and graphingstatistical processes were performed using r®, pass, and microsoft excel® softwares. graphpad prism® software was used for graphing.code availabilitythe custom computer codes used for this study will be made available to the interested readers upon request

The effect of interventions on the transmission and spread of HIV in South Africa: a phylodynamic analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37749-3,Research,25 February 2019,yes,"the epidemic in south africa is characterized by high genetic diversity driven by multiple independent introduction s. the bulk of these introduction s occurred between 1985–2000 during which time hiv prevalence increased exponentially. epidemic growth has stabilized in recent years with the implementation of several interventions. here we identified distinct hiv clades from a large sequence dataset of southern african hiv sequences (n = 15,332). each clade was characterized using phylodynamic and phylogeographic methods to infer their growth through time and space. the estimated date of origin for the 18 clades that were found, fell between 1979–1992 with strong growth during the 1990’s. phylogeographic reconstruction revealed wide dispersal of clades throughout the country with the city of johannesburg as the focal point of viral dispersal. we found clear signs of decreasing growth rate in four of the clades since the advent of interventions, while other clades have continued to growth and expand. our results demonstrate that interventions do not affect the hiv epidemic universally with major difference between different clades over time and space. here we demonstrate the utility and flexibility of molecular epidemiological methods and demonstrate how they can potentially be a powerful tool in hiv epidemic monitoring in south africa.
introduction south africa and southern africa falls in the epicentre of the hiv/aids pandemic. the region is home to <2% of the world’s population, yet accounts for a third of the global hiv disease burden. the hiv epidemic in south africa exploded in the 1990’s. prevalence measured amongst women attending antenatal clinics increased from <1.0% in 1990 to ~24.5% by the end of the decade1. the south african government’s response to the epidemic was initially slow, but since the early 2000s, has become more responsive. the government’s reversal on their prior policy stance – that hiv does not cause aids – has been central to this change. several national campaigns to combat the spread of the virus been launched such as prevention of mother to child transmission (pmtct), as well as the combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) and medical male circumcision. in september of 2016, the government further committed to the adoption of the unaids 90–90–90 strategy, which aims at having 90% of infected individuals diagnosed by 2020, 90% of whom should be on cart, and 90% of those on cart virologically suppressed2.in the context of mass interventions to stop the transmissionim and spread of hiv such as cart, there is a growing need for tools or studies that can measure their effects on the epidemic. standard epidemiological techniques would traditionally be the preferred choice of platform for such studies. however, in recent years, molecular epidemiology studies have emerged, which can provide a broad nuanced view of the epidemic. this makes molecular epidemiology studies attractive measures to complement traditional epidemiological studies3,4,5. these studies draw from recent advancements in sequencing technologies, computational biology and the large amount of hiv sequence data routinely being generated as part of standard of care (i.e. drug resistance testing). the added advantage of molecular epidemiology studies over traditional methods is that they are more cost effective and quicker to perform.previously, we reconstructed the history of the hiv subtype c epidemic in south africa to shed light on when the epidemic emerged, as well as to dynamically model changes in the past viral population size of the epidemic. molecular clock analysis placed the time to the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) of the epidemic around 1960 with the 95% confidence intervals (ci) ranging between 1956 and 19646. more over, a random longitudinal sampling of viral linages within each southern african country will produce similar estimated dates for subtype c. therefore, its clear that the southern african hiv-1 subtype c epidemic share a common ancestor around the 1960. phylodynamic modelling also revealed periods of strong epidemic growth during the late 1970 s and throughout the 1980s in the southern african region. however, when analysing only south african sequences the period of epidemic growth appears to be approximately ten years later with most growth in the mid-80’s and throughout the 1990’s. this 10-year lag in the epidemic growth phase of the south african epidemic is also consistent with hiv prevalence estimates. by the start of the 1990 s the hiv prevalence rate in south africa was ~1.0% of the adult population, while prevalence in zimbabwe at the time was ~10.0%7. in phylogenetic reconstructions of the southern african epidemic we also observe a strong panmixia pattern of dispersal of southern african sequences – with no clear spatial clustering (i.e. lack of supported monophyletic clades including strains specific geographic area).based on such findings, we hypothesized that several independent introduction s of hiv subtype c into south africa over time must have occurred to give rise to the viral genetic heterogeneity we observe today. to this end, we conducted a phylogeographic study of a large southern african dataset (n = 11,289) to infer the number of viral exchanges (imports and exports) of hiv between south africa and its neighbours through a phylogeographic reconstruction8. the results confirmed our hypothesis and identified that the bulk of viral exchanges occurred between 1985 and 2000 with little to no subsequent events. this period of viral introduction s coincided with mass inward migration of people from neighbouring countries into south africa as apartheid was abolished and south africa was re-integrated into the southern african development community (sadc). from these results, it is clear that the hiv epidemic in south africa is actually a composite of multiple, parallel sub-epidemics spreading in the country at the same time, giving rise to the heterogeneity we observe today. this implies that even though the subtype c epidemic in south africa share a common ancestor as far back as 1960, it does not mean that hiv was already circulating in the country at the time. rather, a large number of independent introduction s from across the southern african region much later (1985–2000) has shaped the epidemic, giving rise to the extreme genetic diversity we observe today.we used a similar approach as that used by novitsky and colleagues3, in the present study. we analysed a large sequence dataset of hiv patients from south africa and its neighbouring countries to identify clades that represent sub-epidemics. we applied phylodynamic and phylogeographic methods to each clade to infer their temporal origin and growth as well as their spatiotemporal distribution. we were particularly interested in two main questions: (i) what temporal changes in the growth of clades have occurred, particularly in the period of interventions (2005–2015); and (ii) what has been the spatio-temporal characteristics of clades?resultsdataset and clade identificationaggregated viral genotypes from four different sources produced a sequence dataset of 15,332 sequences. subtyping and recombination analyses identified 75 sequences that were not pure subtype c isolates or showed statistically significant signs of viral recombination. these 75 sequences were removed from the sequence dataset, which resulted in a final dataset of 15,257 sequences. no duplicate sequences were identified. manual editing produced a codon alignment of 1,088 base pairs (bp). the final length of the alignment after 33 codon positions associated with major drug resistance mutation sites were removed was 989 bp long. a breakdown of the 15,257 subtype c polymerase (pol) sequences is provided in supplementary figure 1.we used the 15,257 subtype c sequences to construct a maximum likelihood (ml) tree topology that was used to identify clades in phylotype. we first conducted a sensitivity analysis in phylotype increasing the genetic distance threshold by 0.5% incrementally starting at 2% and working up towards 10%. based on this exercise, an 8% genetic distance cut-off was identified as optimal. at this threshold, we identified a total of 18 clades of interest containing 907 south african sequences (fig. 1). the largest contained 110 sequences that were sampled over the course of ~15 years, while the smallest contained 27 sequences that were sampled over the course of ~9 years (table 1). of the 18 clades, 14 had good temporal signal as determined by tempest, which would allow for phylodynamic and phylogeographic reconstruction. the remaining four had a negative correlation between genetic diversity and sampling times and was not suited for molecular clock analyses.figure 1large-scale phylogenetic reconstruction of the hiv-1

clade.full size imagetable 1 summary of the 18 clades that were identified in the phylotype analysis of the ml-tree.full size tablephylodynamic characterization of cladesthe 14 transmission clades that had good temporal signal were analysed under various coalescent tree priors in a molecular clock framework to infer their estimated dates of origin (supplementary figure 2) as well as their past population growth dynamics (fig. 2). using the marginal likelihoods inferred under the different coalescent tree priors, bayes factor calculations favoured the use of a skyride coalescent tree prior over the use of all other models. this was the case for all of the clades. based on these skyride estimates the inferred tmrca for clades fell in the period between 1979 and 1992. the oldest clade (#12541) had an estimated date of origin around 1979.5 (95% ci: 1973.5–1985.4) while the youngest clade (#9402) had an estimated date of origin around 1992.2 (95% ci: 1987.1–1996.7). these estimated dates of origin are consistent with our previous findings that showed many viral introduction s into south africa from neighbouring countries during the period8.figure 2the inferred phylodynamic trends of 14 south african clades. on the x-axis time in calendar years are represented while on the y-axis the effective population size (ne) are presented. these phylodynamic plots were inferred in tracer using the mean tree height estimate. the grey shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for ne estimates, while the black line represent the median estimate through time.full size imagephylodynamic modelling of the past population growth through time of the 14 clades revealed strong exponential growth in the effective population size (ne) throughout the 1980’s and 90’s. since 2000 the growth in clades appears to have stabilized. these observations are in concordance with the rising prevalence trends of hiv that was observed in south africa during this period. we observed decreases in the effective population size for several clades (#5302, #6804, #10779, #11400, #12541, #13212, #23106, #23376 and #25877) in more recent years. these decreases coincide with the period of interventions (2005–2015), such as the role-out of cart and medical male circumcision campaigns. however, these decrease were not observed in all of the clades. for example, in clade #9402, a small period of decline in the population size was observed between 2005 and 2010, but has since entered a new growth phase. similarly, small decreases was observed for clades #13580, #24589 and #28759 however these decreases were not significant based on their 95% confidence intervals. finally, instead of a decrease, a small increase in growth was observed for clade #14595 over the period from 2010 to 2015.birth-death coalescent reconstruction of epidemiological parametersepidemiological parameters that were inferred from clades under the birth-death coalescent model (fig. 3 and supplementary figure 3) correlates with our phylodynamic reconstruction of the past population size (ne) of clades (fig. 2). in four clades we observed the median r0 estimate as well as the 95% ci fall below 1 at the most recent time of sampling. the inferred temporal changes in r0 for clade #11400 revealed high r0 estimates for the period leading up to 2012 when r0 decreased to ~0.651 (95% ci: 0.420–0.887). on the other hand, the becoming uninfectious rate for this clade were very low leading up to 2012, when it increased to approximately a rate of 1.118 (95% ci: 0.432–2.081). for clade #23106, the inferred temporal changes in r0 suggest high growth potential up until 2006/2007 after which is decrease slightly for about two years. our inference further suggests that this small decrease were followed by a small expansion (2010–2012) after which r0 decreased to a median of 0.676 (95% ci: 0.317–0.922). conversely, the δ rate for this clade remains very low up until 2006/2007, which is followed by three incremental increases. at the last point of sampling the median δ rate was 1.245 (95% ci: 0.369–2.710).figure 3the inferred temporal changes in the estimated basic reproductive number and becoming uninfectious rate for seven south african clades for whom decreases in ne was observed. the red solid lines represents the median estimate for r0 while the red shaded areas represent the 95% confidence interval for r0 estimates. the solid blue lines represent the median estimate for δ, while the blue shaded areas represents the 95% confidence interval for δ estimates.full size imagethe inferred temporal changes in r0 and the δ rate for clade #23376 revealed consistently high r0 estimates up until ~2009 after which r0 decreased. conversely, the δ rate for this clade remained fairly low until ~2012 after which it increased. at the last time point of sampling the median r0 estimate was 0.708 (95% ci: 0.428–0.988), while the median δ estimated was 1.164 (95% ci: 0.409–2.188). finally, our inferred temporal changes in r0 and the δ rate for clade #25877 revealed high r0 estimates leading up to 2005, after which it has decreased until ~2012. however, during this period the r0 95% ci remain fairly wide until ~2012 after which r0 decreased to a median of 0.475 (95% ci: 0.263–0.908). on the other hand, the δ rate for this clade remains very low throughout its lifespan up until ~2012, after which it increases to ~1.465 (95% ci: 0.382–3.365).for the other clades for which we observed a decrease in the ne (clades #5302, #6804, #10779, #12541 and #13212) at the most recent time of sampling, we observed decreases in r0 below 1, while the δ rate increases. however, the 95% ci for r0 at the most recent time of sampling still falls above 1, therefore we cannot be absolutely sure about the decreasing trend in these clades. for the remaining clades (#9402, #13580, #14595, #24589, #28759) the relatively high r0 estimates and low δ rates partially explains why some of these clades continue to grow and why some clades remain stable in the era of hiv interventions.phylogeographic reconstruction of south african cladeswe were able to reconstruct the geographic diffusion of transmission chains for 13 of the 14 clades with good molecular clock signal, which revealed a wide geographic circulation throughout the country. keeping with prior convention, the phylogeographic reconstruction of the seven clades with clear signs of a decrease in the growth of clades are presented in the main text here (fig. 4), while the remaining seven clades’ the phylogeographic reconstruction are presented in supplementary materials (supplementary figure 4). for clades #5302 and #6804, our phylogeographic reconstruction revealed the central region of kwazulu-natal as the most likely ancestral location for these transmission clades. for both clades our reconstruction inferred spread from this central location in kwazulu-natal to the northern regions of the province close to the mozambican and swaziland borders as well as viral spread to the city of johannesburg by 2004. since then these transmission chains have widely been dispersed including locations in cape town, port elizabeth, mthatha and the central interior of the country.figure 4temporal dynamics of hiv-1 subtype c spatial diffusion in seven south african clades. lines between sites represent possible transitions of the virus between south african towns or cities. all transitions between locations have been plotted in this figure. circle diameters are proportional to the square root of the number of mcc branches that maintain the same location state at each time-point. the map is based on satellite pictures available in google earth (http://earth.google.com).full size imagethe spatiotemporal reconstruction of all other clades revealed the city of johannesburg, as the most like ancestral location for all of the other clades. from johannesburg, clades appears to spread quickly to other locations within south africa, including hyper endemic areas of kwazulu-natal, to kimberly and bloemfontein in the interior of the country, to mpumalanga in the lowveld, and areas in the western and eastern cape. due to a lack of geographic variation in the sampling locations of sequences, phylogeographic reconstruction of clade #23376 could not be performed as 98% of this clade’s sequences were generated from sampling of hiv infected patients from chris hani baragwanath hospital in soweto.discussion the phylogenetic reconstruction and phylotype analysis of the southern african hiv-1 subtype c epidemic revealed 18 south african clades of interest containing 907 sequences (9.7% of all south african sequences). each one of these clades represents putative chains of hiv transmission within the country. phylodynamic modelling of clades identified distinct growth patterns through time. since the introduction  and expansion of cart and other hiv interventions, the majority of clades decreased in size. however, in the context of these interventions others have actually expanded, which suggests that interventions do not affect the growth of clusters uniformly. more importantly, we have demonstrated here that molecular epidemiological inference of hiv can be used as a potentially powerful tool in the future to monitor the epidemic in south africa. in the context of mass interventions such as cart and 90-90-90, these methods in the future has the potential to identify demographic groups or geographic areas where interventions are not performing optimally, complimenting existing surveillance of the epidemic. in turn the resulting information that is gained can be used to strengthen the public health response and design better targeted interventions amongst key demographic group or geographic areas.due to the high degree of genetic diversity that characterizes the hiv epidemic in the southern african region (supplementary figure 1d), we deliberately used very stringent criteria towards the identification of clades. traditionally, closely associated viral strains of hiv are normally identified through the combined use of branch support and the use of a genetic distance threshold3,4,5. for the identification of transmission clusters, conservative cut-off values are normally used. for example, high branch support (>90%) and a low intra-cluster genetic distance threshold (2–4.5%)4,5,9. our aim was not to identify highly similar clusters that represent putative chains of transmission, but rather to identify clades of hiv-1 subtype c in south africa representing “sub-epidemics” resulting from independent introduction s into the country. to this end we used a very conservative >95% branch support threshold cut-off. the use of a genetic distance threshold in molecular epidemiology studies, as with branch support thresholds, has often been an ad-hoc choice, with no clear cut-off, which prompted us to explore different genetic distance thresholds (supplementary figure 5). our sensitivity analysis favoured the use of an 8.0% genetic distance cut-off to optimize the size and numbers of clades. in a recent publication we demonstrated that as you move from the terminal tips of the tree towards the root we observe a sharp decrease in felsenstein’s bootstrap10. therefore, given the relative depth of branches leading to our clades of interest and the large number of taxa in our phylogeny we are confident in the assignment of these clades.of the 18 clades that were identified, only 14 showed good signs of having good molecular clock signal. bayesian coalescent reconstruction of the 14 clades place their estimated dates of origin in the 1980’s or early 1990’s. this falls within the 1985–2000 time period, which is consistent with our earlier findings, which proofed that several viral introduction s into south africa occurred during this time period that gave rise to several sub-epidemics. the reconstruction of the clades past population dynamics revealed strong growth in the ne throughout the 1990’s (fig. 3). these trends are consistent with hiv prevalence estimates over this time period as national prevalence trends increased from <1.0% to ~24.5%7. the reduction in the growth of ne for some clades follows the initiation of the national cart campaign in 2004 and coincides with the expansion of access to therapy since 2009 and other interventions. in particular the decline and growth phase we observe in cluster #9402 really emphasises the potential power of molecular epidemiology methods to alert healthcare works of on going growth in some sup-epidemics, which can be used to design better targeted interventions.however, the effective population size as a measure of relative genetic diversity only provides us with a nascent view of the past population dynamics. to investigate the observed decline in the ne since the introduction  of cart in greater detail we reconstructed the basic reproductive number of clades through time using a structured birth-death coalescent model11. the basic reproductive number provides an estimate of the number of new infections every infection would cause over the course of their infectious life. a r0 of one would indicate a stable epidemic with no growth or decline, while a r0 below one represents a shrinking epidemic (i.e. a decline in growth). our birth-death coalescent reconstruction of the clades identified four (#11400, #23106, #23376 & #25877) where the median r0 estimate, including the 95% ci, were below one at the most recent time of sampling. this reduction in r0 was also accompanied with an increase in the uninfectious rate over the same time period. however, this decrease has only been observed in four of the fourteen clades on which molecular clock and birth-death coalescent modelling was performed. in the remaining clades no clear signs of decline in the r0 were noticed. it is therefore clear that some clades have stopped growing in the era of interventions (2005-present), while others have either remained stable or has continued to grow and spread. given the lack of additional patient information that can be analysed in conjunction with the sequences it is difficult to ascertain exactly why other clades have continued to expand despite interventions such as increasing access to hiv testing and treatment.the national cart campaign was launched in 2004. however, role out was initially slow with therapy only being administered at a cd4 cell count of <200-cells/ml blood12. between 2004 and 2009, only ~600,000 people were initiated on therapy at this threshold. by 2009, government adjusted initiation criteria upwards to <350-cells/ml of blood for patients co-infected with hiv and tb and for all pregnant women who are infected. by 2013, initiation criteria were adjusted to <350-cells/ml blood for all patients and in 2015 was adjusted upwards again to <500-cells/ml blood. by 2015, ~3 million hiv positive south africans were enrolled on therapy, making the south african national hiv treatment campaign the largest in the world, which constitutes a 30-fold increase in the number of individuals on cart when compared to 200512,13 (table 2). since the introduction  of therapy the national hiv incidence estimate amongst the sexually active population (aged 15–49 years) has decreased from 1.88 to 0.91. of course its difficult to quantify what effect access to therapy has had, but it is safe to assume that this decline in incidence can in part be attributed to it. conversely, the hiv prevalence rate amongst the same population group has remained stable over the same time period (2004–2017)13. this is to be expected as more hiv infected individuals are living longer due to the benefits of therapy. however, as of 2015 only 48.6% (95% ci: 46.0–51.2%) of hiv positive individuals were on cart. additionally, of the hiv positive population in south africa only ~26% were on cart and virally suppressed. this figure is extremely low considering that viral suppression is the most important determinant of future hiv incidence trends in the south africa12,14.table 2 number of hiv positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) since the start of the national treatment campaign in 2004.full size tablethe phylogeographic reconstruction of transmission chains revealed a diverse geographic diffusion throughout the country over time (fig. 3). the spatio-temporal reconstruction revealed linkage between urban and rural population centres across the country. johannesburg appears to be a major centre for hiv transmission in south africa. phylogeographic reconstruction placed the estimated ancestral location of all but two of the clades in the city, with clades (#5302 & #6804) originating in kwazulu-natal from where they spread to johannesburg and further throughout the country. the cluster for which phylogeographic reconstruction was not possible, due to constrains in its sequence locations, were predominantly sampled in and around the city of johannesburg. the general trends we observed in our reconstruction supports the hypothesis that migrants, primarily in large urban areas, introduced hiv into south africa from where it then spread onwards to rural communities. these urban-rural viral diffusion pathways coupled with high rates of infection has resulted in the extremely high prevalence rates that we now observe in hyper-endemic rural settings of kwazulu-natal such as those covered by the ahri and caprisa population surveillance platforms9,15. these rural-urban transmission pathways and the vast geographical dispersal of clusters underscore the need for increased testing and treatment of individuals in high incidence and prevalence communities and the engagement of high-risk individuals (msm, commercial sex workers, migrants and long distance truck drivers) throughout the country.there are a couple of caveats to our reconstruction of the south african hiv epidemic. firstly, our reconstruction was restricted to the use of a small fragment of the polymerase gene of the virus. the use of a small fragment from a single gene fundamentally limits our ability to accurately reconstruct the epidemic in the region and such a study would greatly benefit from the use of whole genome hiv sequences, as their use would assure better support for the branching structure in viral genealogies. however, the availability of whole genome hiv sequences from the region is limited to a small number contained in sequence databases (n < 500) or to very specific studies and research sites. the use of whole genome sequences for this study would therefore have restricted us to only a few hundred sequences as compared to several thousand when using pol. furthermore, it has been demonstrated previously that hiv pol carries enough phylogenetic signal to accurately reconstruct phylogenetic clades/clusters16. our study, using pol sequences, should therefore be able to reconstruct the underlying epidemic dynamics of hiv in the region to a reasonably good degree of success.secondly, given the convenient nature of sampling sources such as those drawn from drug resistance cohorts and public databases, it is evident that sampling from some geographic regions of south africa and the southern african region might be underrepresented. for example, no sequences are currently available from lesotho or namibia, even though these countries are ranked second and fifth in the world in terms of hiv prevalence respectively. their absence from any phylogenetic reconstruction of the epidemic in the region therefore constitutes a serious limitation. moreover, within the south african context, sequences from north west province are lacking entirely, while genotypes from mpumalanga, limpopo, the northern cape and the free state were generally underrepresented in comparison to the other provinces (supplementary figure 1). conversely, the inclusion of sequences coupled to large demographic study sites such as arhi and caprisa could lead to the overrepresentation of sampling from two hyper endemic settings in kwazulu-natal. the over- and underrepresentation of sequences from different geographic loci could therefore bias the phylogenetic and phylogeographic reconstruction that we were performed in the current study. therefore, we can only reliably discuss viral spatial diffusion patterns between the four most highly sampled locations within the country (i.e. gauteng, kwazulu-natal and the eastern and western cape province). that being said, the results overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that johannesburg was indeed the focal point of viral spread in south africa, from where clades quickly spread to other urban centres and rural areas.finally, the genotype dataset that we used provided us with no other additional clinical, demographic, behavioural or socio-economic data. this has limited our reconstruction of the epidemic only to both time (temporal changes) and space (geographic spread). the inclusion of additional variables would have allowed us to identify how different risk factors contribute to hiv epidemic spread in the region. such information would have been useful to determine why some clusters have shrunk since the introduction  of cart and why some continue to grow and expanded in the presence of hiv interventions. this underscore the need for a national hiv sequence and patient database which could serve as the basis for the development of dynamic systems that can track the spread of hiv in the era of mass interventions.in conclusion , our results clearly demonstrate that in the current context, where ~50% of hiv infected individuals are accessing treatment we could only observe clear decreases in the size of four of the clades we identified. furthermore, our phylogeographic reconstruction underscores the wide geographic dispersal of hiv within south africa. given the wide geographic dispersal and the large scope of the hiv epidemic it is clear that wide ranging hiv interventions on a national scale is urgently needed – above and beyond the current status quo - to curb the growth of the epidemic. the proposed 90-90-90 strategy holds great promise, but in the context of the current poor viral suppression rates, there is little evidence that the final 90% object can be achieved. it is clear, that continued surveillance of the epidemic is needed to capitalize on the expansion of treatment. in the context of mass interventions, phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods, applied to the ever-increasing number of viral genotypes that are being produced, can provide insights about the underlying dynamics that is shaping the epidemic in the country. this knowledge in turn could be used by local and national health services to design better-targeted interventions in the future.methodsethical considerationsthe use of sequences from public sequence repositories like genbank and the hiv database at los alamos national laboratory (lanl) are not

the south african medical research council (samrc) guidelines as well as the south african department of health (sa-ndoh) guidelines.samplinghiv sampling was drawn from various sources, including regional surveillance sites, national drug resistance cohorts, and public domain sequences contained in databases. we chose the hiv polymerase (pol) gene for our phylogenetic reconstruction due to its relative abundance and its wide use for clinical management and surveillance of drug resistance. sampling was drawn from four major sources including: a large national hiv drug resistance cohort managed by the division of medical virology at stellenbosch university, community surveillance platforms of caprisa and ahri, and all public hiv pol sequences from southern african countries with known dates of isolation (position 2250–3300 relative to hxb2). all sequences were aggregated into one single data frame and curated with dates of isolation, sampling/gps locations, gender, age and any other covariates that could be linked to genotypes.our dataset combined from our four different sources contained in total 15,332 sequences. the national hiv drug resistance dataset comprised the bulk of sequence (n = 5,926) followed by publicly available sequences from the los alamos national laboratory hiv specific sequence database (n = 4,371; date of access 19th may 2017). caprisa and ahri each contributed 1,661 and 3,374 respectively to the dataset.phylogenetic reconstruction and clade identificationfirst, all sequences were subtyped with the rega v 3.0 subtyping tool17 and the stand-alone version of the jumping profile hidden markov model (jphmm) subtyping tool (http://jphmm.gobics.de)18. all non-subtype c isolates were removed from the dataset prior to phylogenetic reconstruction. as viral recombination can seriously affect phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference we analysed all sequences for the presence of recombination signal in rpd419. rdp4 utilizes a combination of non-parametric recombination detection methods, such as rdp20, bootscan21, chimaera22, siscan23, and 3seq24.next, hiv-1 subtype c polymerase (pol) sequences were aligned against one another along with a homologous section of the hxb2 reference strain25 in muscle v 3.526. the resulting alignment was manually edited in geneious v 8.1.8 until a perfect codon alignment was achieved and codon positions associated with major hiv drug resistance mutations were removed (https://github.com/olli0601/big.phylo). the resulting alignment was used to infer a maximum likelihood (ml) genealogy with iq-tree27. prior to tree inference the modelfinder package28 in iq-tree was used to identify the best fitting model of nucleotide substitution. simultaneously, we screened for possible duplicate sequences in our sequence alignment with the help of iq-tree, which has a build in functionality to detect identical sequences quickly and easily. subsequently the ml-tree topology was inferred with the general time reversible (gtr) model of nucleotide substitution29 and a gamma correction for among site rate variation30. the ultrafast bootstrap method was utilized to infer support for branching in the tree topology (1000 replicates). clades representing putative independent introduction s of hiv-1 subtype c into south were identified in the resulting ml-tree with phylotype31 using the following basic search parameters: size ≥ 25 of south african sequences; difference ≤2 (which allows two or less non-south african sequences in each per clade); local branch or bootstrap support ≥95%, and an intra-cluster genetic cut-off threshold. we varied the intra-cluster genetic distance cut-off between 2% and 10% at 0.5% intervals to identify the optimal threshold for our data. we restricted the minimum size to ≥25 sequences in order to insure that a large enough sample was obtained that would allow for molecular clock analyses. we allowed a difference of <2 sequences (i.e. non-south african sequences) per clade as its clear that there are a large degree of viral flow between different southern african countries. with regards to branch support we purposefully set strict cut-offs to reduce the possibility of identifying a false clade. finally, we choose to identify clades using phylotype over other methods such as clusterpicker32 or hiv-trace33, as this method allows us to search for phylotypes or clades that match a specific characteristic or geographic sampling location.phylodynamic modelling of cladesprior to phylodynamic and phylogeographic reconstruction, each clade was evaluated in tempest (http://beast.community/tempest) to quantify temporal signal. all clades that had a positive correlation between genetic diversity and time were analysed to infer their estimated date of origin, as well as their temporal growth and geographic dispersal through time.clades were analysed in beast v 1.8.4 (http://beast.community/beast) under a relaxed lognormal molecular clock, an estimated mutation rate and different coalescent tree priors to infer the tmrca and viral ne dynamic through time. for each clade five different tree priors were tested: constant and exponential growth34, as well as non-parametric bayesian-skyline35, bayesian-skyride36, and bayesian-skygrid37 tree priors. each demographic coalescent model was run in duplicate for 1 billion markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) generations, with samples being drawn from the posterior every 100,000 generations. good mixing and convergence in the chains were assessed in tracer (http://beast.community/tracer) based on high effective sample sizes of each estimated parameter (ess > 200) after the first 10% of the samples were discarded as burn-in. bayes factor comparison between different coalescent tree priors were performed to determine which coalescent model fitted the data best.to assess the epidemic growth potential in clades, each one was also analysed under an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock model and a birth-death skyline serial coalescent tree prior11. the mutation rate for the birth-death coalescent model was fixed at 1.8 × 10−3 mutations/site/year, based on previous estimates for hiv subtype c pol6,8. additionally, we used the gtr substitution model with a gamma distributed rate variation across sites in beast v 2.4.6 (www.beast2.org). a two-dimensional sampling proportion was enforced with the sampling fixed to zero prior to the first sample date in each clade followed by an estimated sampling proportion. the mcmc was run for 1 billion generations and samples drawn from the posterior every 100,000 generations. again, proper mixing was assessed in tracer based on high ess values after discarding the first 10% of posterior values as burn-in. r0 estimates, the becoming un-infectious rate, and the sampling proportion were plotted over time using the ggplot2 package in r38.spatiotemporal reconstruction of south african cladesthe origin and spatiotemporal dynamics of subtype c clades were investigated using a bayesian phylogeographic approach implemented in beast v 1.8.439. analysis were performed under a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model40 with the gtr + g + i nucleotide substitution model. the substitution rate was modelled by a uniform distribution with mean 1.8 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year6,8 and the non-parametric bayesian skyride model was used as coalescent tree prior36. bayesian stochastic search variable selection (bssvs) was employed to estimate viral migrations between locations41. mcmc chains were run for up to 300 million generations and proper mixing was evaluated individually in tracer v 1.6 excluding an initial 10% for burn-in. maximum clade credibility (mcc) trees were computed in treeannotator v1.8.4, and visualized in figtree v1.4.3. migratory events were summarized using the spread platform42.

A child with perinatal HIV infection and long-term sustained virological control following antiretroviral treatment cessation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08311-0,Research,24 January 2019,yes,"understanding hiv remission in rare individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy (art) soon after infection and then discontinued, may inform hiv cure interventions. here we describe features of virus and host of a perinatally hiv-1 infected child with long-term sustained virological control. the child received early limited art in the children with hiv early antiretroviral therapy (cher) trial. at age 9.5 years, diagnostic tests for hiv are negative and the child has characteristics similar to uninfected children that include a high cd4:cd8 ratio, low t cell activation and low ccr5 expression. virus persistence (hiv-1 dna and plasma rna) is confirmed with sensitive methods, but replication-competent virus is not detected. the child has weak hiv-specific antibody and t cell responses. furthermore, we determine his hla and kir genotypes. this case aids in understanding post-treatment control and may help design of future intervention strategies.
introduction rapid formation of persistent viral reservoirs follows acute hiv-1 infection. this early establishment of latently hiv-1-infected cd4+ t cells harbouring replication-competent virus remains the major obstacle to hiv cure or remission1,2,3. as antiretroviral therapy (art), even when given within days of infection, usually fails to clear these reservoirs4,5,6, it is unlikely that art alone can lead to hiv remission. it is, however, hypothesized that art given very soon after infection may enable a more effective immune response and, together with other strategies, lead to sustained control of viral replication.current approaches to hiv cure or remission have focused on either reversing latency (e.g. “shock and kill”), enhancing immune responses or preventing immune activation (e.g. vaccines and other immunotherapies)7. central to the question of hiv remission is the interaction between viral reservoir, immune activation, host genetics and immune response.several adult cases of post-treatment control have been described8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. these individuals are unlike elite controllers (<1%) who control hiv-1 to undetectable levels in the absence of art17,18, probably through distinct immunological mechanisms8.in children, data are extremely limited. in 2013, the report of the “mississippi baby” suggested that very early art, here within 30 h of birth, could lead to prolonged (27 months) virological control off-treatment19,20, raising hope for a feasible hiv-1 remission strategy. unfortunately, this girl “relapsed” after almost 2 years without art due to return of high levels of viral replication, and required art. subsequently, a french girl was reported who started art at 3 months of age, stopped treatment between 5 and 7 years of age and controlled virus to undetectable levels for over 12 years21.reports of post-treatment controllers who initiated art and then discontinued by design or unintentionally may help our understanding of key host determinants of hiv replication control, and inform interventions for hiv remission and cure.here we report a detailed virological and immunological analysis of a child at 9.5 years of age, originally enroled in the children with hiv early antiretroviral therapy (cher) trial22,23 who was randomized to the immediate, time-limited 40 weeks of art study arm. the cher trial was initiated at a time when the best strategy on when to initiate and how to maintain treatment in infants was unclear. this child, one of 227 early treated children (0.4%), is the only one maintaining long-term sustained virological control post-art cessation. at 9.5 years, virus persists at low levels (plasma rna 6.6 copies per ml), cell-associated dna is 5 copies per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells and replication-competent virus is not detected. immunologically, he is not unlike healthy children of similar age, evidenced by high cd4:cd8 ratio, low t cell activation and low ccr5 expression. he has weak hiv-specific antibody and cd4+ t cell responses indicating memory of prior/current virus encounter, and together with possession of some host genotypes, these provide clues for future studies to inform what constitutes long-term post-treatment control.resultsclinical casethe child, born in 2007, had a positive hiv-1 dna pcr at age 32 days. at 39 days, hiv-1 rna was >750,000 copies per ml (upper limit of quantitation of the assay) confirming infection; at 60 days, plasma hiv rna had declined to 151,000 copies per ml. he commenced zidovudine, lamivudine and lopinavir-ritonavir one day later (fig. 1, supplementary table 1). he was born at term, of normal birth weight (3700g), did not receive nevirapine prophylaxis, and was not breastfed. cd4+ t cell count and per cent at 61 days, prior to art start, were 2249 cells per µl and 41.6%. these values fell within the respective baseline interquartile ranges (iqrs) for all early treated children who stopped art in the cher trial (supplementary table 2)—n = 227 children; median cd4+ t cell count was 2255 (iqr: 1759–2972); median cd4% 36.4 (iqr: 31.4–42.5).fig. 1longitudinal viral loads and cd4+ t cell counts. a–c viral load (log10 rna copies per ml) (a), absolute cd4+ t cell count (cells per µl) (b) and cd4+ t cell percentage (c) are shown over time up to age 9.5 years (open circles joined by red dotted lines). pre-art, early art and post-art periods are indicated (shaded in lavender, pink, pale green, respectively). the x-axis shows age in weeks and then in years, separated by a blue vertical dotted line. note: the detection limit of the vl assays used was 400 rna copies per ml at 10.71 and 116.71 weeks; 50 rna copies per ml at 33.71 weeks and 20 rna copies per ml at all other time points. art antiretroviral therapyfull size imageviral load (vl) declined to <50 rna copies per ml after 24 weeks of art. at 50 weeks of age, when treatment was stopped per trial protocol, vl was <20 copies per ml. thereafter, vl remained below detection over 8.75 years without art (fig. 1a). cd4+ t cell counts remained normal-for-age (fig. 1b) and cd4% remained above 30% throughout (fig. 1c). at 9.5 years plasma drug concentrations for the most commonly used antiretroviral agents in south africa were undetectable. the mother’s cd4+ t cell count was 108 cells per µl when he was 7 months of age, and then 129 cells per µl 20 months later—these are the only maternal data available.virus persistenceat 9.5 years, the roche vl result was reported as target not detected (tnd; fig. 2a). virus pelleted from 10 ml of plasma, yielded 66 copies and a vl of 6.6 rna copies per ml (fig. 2a). using a highly sensitive rna nested qpcr on 3 ml of plasma, 2 of 22 replicates were positive (fig. 2a). using a semi-nested real-time pcr (sn-qpcr) assay and an input of 1 µg of genomic dna (gdna) per well, total cell-associated hiv-1 dna was estimated at 5 copies per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs; six of nine amplifications positive) (fig. 2b). in a stored sample from art interruption at 50 weeks of age, this was almost identical (5 copies per 106 pbmcs: 1 of 3 amplifications positive). dna sequencing of gag from the 9.5 year sample confirmed infection with subtype c virus (fig. 2c). using two virus outgrowth assays (primary cd8-depleted pbmcs and molt4/ccr5 cells), no replication-competent virus was detected at 9.5 years (fig. 2d). however, a weak hiv rna signal (1 of 24 replicates was positive) was detected in the day 28 supernatant of cultured primary cd4+ cells from the 50-week sample using qualitative real-time pcr nested assay (n-qpcr). the child’s cd4+ t cells could be infected in vitro with the hiv-1 bal strain (fig. 2d).fig. 2detection of hiv

the child showed a substantial iga2 response to gp41, and weak but detectable responses to gp120 and vpu (igg1), gag (igg2), tat (igg2, igg3, iga1) and vpu9 peptide (igm) (fig. 3b).fig. 3hiv-specific

interleukin-2/interferon-γ (il-2/ifn-γ)+cd3−cd56+ cells) (fig. 3c). a weak (0.116%) cd4+ t cell response to gag was detected, without detectable cd8+ t cell responses to any peptide pool (fig. 3d).host genotypingall hla loci were heterozygous: a*30:02:01/66:01; b*08:01:01/44:03:01; c*04:01:01/07:01:01; dpb1*01:01:01/18:01; dqb1*05:01:01/06:09:01; drb1*12:01:01/13:02:01 (fig. 4a). the child’s kiraa1 genotype, the most common genotype globally, included both full-length (f) and truncated (v) kir2ds4 alleles (fig. 4b). these are among features that we have associated with greater risk of transmission/acquisition of hiv-1 infection in mother-to-child transmission studies24,25. hla b*44:03:01 has a threonine (t) at position 80 as part of the bw4 epitope (nlrtalr) of the α1 helix

interaction with both kir2dl3 (c1) and 2dl1 (c2) on nk cells. collectively, these genotyping data suggest the potential for diverse interactions that may include engagement of cd4 and cd8 t cells and nk cells in antiviral responses.fig. 4hla class i and ii alleles and kir genotype. a hla class i a, b and c with corresponding allotype designations (non-bw4, bw6, bw4-80ta, c1 and c2), and hla class

differentiation highlighted that 9.5–10-year-old hiv-uninfected children do not display adult-like proportions of the different subsets, particularly for naive, central memory and effector memory cd4+

children/adults (fig. 5c). proportions of the child’s ccr5-expressing cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were comparable to those of uninfected children. of note, ccr5-expressing cd8+ t cells were significantly higher in adults than children (p = 0.0013; mann–whitney u test). levels of immune activation, measured by hla-dr, were similar to those of uninfected children and adults. expression of tigit in the child’s cd4+ and cd8+ t cells was similar to uninfected children, and significantly higher in adults (p = 0.027 and p = 0.0027, respectively; mann–whitney u tests). pd-1 expression on the child’s cd4+ t cells was substantially above the median values for children or adults. however, two adult outliers had similarly high levels. similar to tigit, pd-1 expression on cd8+ t cells was significantly higher in adults than in children (p = 0.0007; mann–whitney u test), with the child having high levels similar to the adult median. flow cytometry data are provided in supplementary table 3.discussion we report virological and immunological characteristics in a south african child of 9.5 years of age in long-term hiv remission. he initiated art at 8.7 weeks of age and discontinued art after 40 weeks in accordance to his randomization in the cher trial22. this is the only child to achieve this outcome among 227 who stopped art (at 40 or 96 weeks) in the trial (0.4%). the french case of long-term remission was one of 15 children in the french paediatric cohort who stopped art (6.7%)21.studies have shown that earlier art initiation results in a smaller hiv reservoir size26,27,28. treatment was very early (within 30 h of birth) for the mississippi baby who achieved 27 months of virological control off-treatment before experiencing virological rebound19,20. this delay in rebound may have been attributed to a small size of latent replication-competent reservoir. both the french case with >12 years of remission21 and this south african case started art later, at 3 and 2 months, respectively. hiv transmission was likely intrapartum in the french child and in utero in the mississippi baby. the timing is unknown for the south african child. timing of transmission may have been a key factor affecting the different outcomes of remission. of note, subtype of virus (b, h and c, respectively), treatment duration (18 months, 6 years, 10 months, respectively) and ethnicity were different in these children. both earlier cases were girls, while this is the first report of a boy with hiv remission. unlike the south african child, using similar methods and number of cd4+ t cells, replication-competent virus was readily found in the french case21. in contrast, no replication-competent virus was found in the mississippi baby when testing 22 million cd4+ t cells19, highlighting that this measure poorly predicts long-term likelihood of remission. furthermore, recent reports of very early treatment in adult cases (within 2 weeks of infection) described multiple sensitive tests for hiv-1 persistence, which supported the absence of detectable virus during art—these cases all rebounded shortly after art was stopped (n = 8 patients5; median 26 days, range 13–48 days; n = 1 patient6, 225 days). collectively, these findings suggest some limited viral replication may in fact be required for durable long-term remission.early in infection the child’s vls were high, indicative of a highly replicating virus. the vl declined from >750,000 to 150,000 rna copies per ml prior to beginning treatment, suggesting an immune response attempting to control virus replication. after art initiation, viral decline was biphasic, with the expected initial sharp decline followed by a more gradual decline. after art cessation, vls remained below the detection threshold for 8.75 years.more sensitive methods for vl measurement confirmed the presence of low amounts of virus produced in vivo (6.6 rna copies per ml). inability to detect replication-competent virus in vitro may be because of assay sensitivity (2 million cd4+ cells tested), or defective virus that cannot accumulate to detectable levels.early initiation of art is associated with non-reactive hiv antibody results in many hiv-1-infected children and adults29,30,31. on standard assays the child is seronegative; however, results from bead arrays revealed footprints of historical adaptive responses that have either waned or are being maintained through ongoing antigenic priming. the substantial iga2 (mucosal) response to gp41 could be primed by microbial antigens sharing homology with gp4132,33,34. however, a recent study reported stronger gp41-specific iga responses in elite controllers, which could not be well explained by responses to microbial antigens35. hiv-1 env- and vpu-specific nk cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) responses, including against c-terminal peptide vpu19 (our vpu9 peptide), are associated with elite hiv-1 control36. using a whole blood assay, we have shown similar responses associated with reduced maternal–infant hiv-1 transmission and lower vls in hiv-1-infected mothers37,38. the child lacked a detectable nk cell response to any hiv-1 peptide pool, likely due to very low levels of antibodies that target env and vpu. the vpu9-igm antibody response suggests a potential for interaction with complement. anti-tat igg responses have also been associated with natural hiv-1 control and improved immune function in art-treated patients receiving tat vaccine39,40,41,42. interestingly, an african study highlighted that persistent anti-tat igm in addition to igg might be protective against disease progression41.an igg2 antibody response to gag has been associated with cd4+ t cell response and long-term nonprogression43. the child had both responses. the weak gag-specific cd4+ t cell response without a detectable cd8+ t cell response is intriguing. such responses are reported in hiv-exposed uninfected individuals and some hiv-uninfected individuals, only when using sensitive cultured elispot assays44. however, the opposite exists in untreated hiv-1-infected infants where we readily demonstrated gag-specific cd8+, but not cd4+ hiv-specific t cell responses in the first few months of life—using the same whole blood intracellular cytokine assay as for the present study45. furthermore, there is an absence of sustained hiv-specific t cell responses in early art-treated hiv-1-infected children46. the cd4+ gag response demonstrated in the child seems remarkable given early treatment and long duration of viral suppression. the cd4+ t cell response may be maintained by small amounts of virus (replication-competent or replication-defective) or gag protein produced in vivo. lack of cd8+ t cell response suggests that cd8+ t cells might not be currently involved in controlling levels of viraemia, supporting the possibility that hiv may be defective for further infection of permissive cells. in keeping with this, we hypothesize the hiv-1 reservoir in the child may be maintained through homeostatic, antigen-stimulated or integration site-dependent proliferation of cd4+ t cells harbouring transcription/translation-competent but not necessarily replication-competent hiv-1. these cellular proliferative mechanisms present a challenge for hiv-1 eradication strategies47. in contrast, the french case showed weak but broader cd4+ and cd8+ t cell responses to gag, pol and nef, and with readily achievable viral proliferation in culture21.these collective findings raise questions of whether cross-reacting antigens might, in addition to small amounts of virus production in vivo, contribute to maintaining some of these memory responses—and, if such responses contributed to remission in this child. importantly, lack of detection does not preclude having cd8+ t cell responses48, or other protective responses such as adcc/phagocytosis in the presence of maternal/child antibody, that may have been active early in life and possibly essential to the outcome of hiv-1 remission. the rapid decline in vl over a month prior to art initiation may be of considerable importance in understanding the reasons behind virological control in the child. art may have protected an early pre-art antiviral response that may otherwise have been compromised by continued viral replication.the child had no hla class i alleles shown in adults to associate with hiv-1 control49, except for heterozygosity at all hla loci that is considered advantageous50. in contrast, the french case was homozygous at three loci, considered disadvantageous21. the child possesses hla class ii alleles already associated with the robust mucosal cd4+ t cell responses in elite controllers (dqb1*06 and drb1*13:02:01)51. dqb1*06 has also been associated with iga responses to v1v2 and increased risk of acquisition in the rv144 hiv vaccine trial52. possession of these class ii alleles may explain why the cd4+ gag response remains detectable at 9.5 years, despite the low-level antigenic exposure. kir genotyping revealed some features already associated with greater risk of vertical transmission in mother-to-child hiv transmission studies24,25.the child had a healthy cd4:cd8 t cell ratio and levels of immune activation similar to healthy uninfected children of similar age. robust t cell and nk cell responses to stimuli suggested a good immune response capability. ccr5 density on t cells was amongst the lowest when compared to hiv-uninfected children or adults—a feature that may be advantageous. although the child’s pd-1-expressing cd4+ t cell proportions were higher than children and adults, pd-1-expressing cd8+ t cells were comparable to adults but much higher than children. high pd-1 expression is unlikely from immune exhaustion given no evidence of high immune activation in the child unlike in chronic untreated and virologically suppressed art-treated hiv-1 infection53,54. in this regard tigit, another marker of immune exhaustion, is not different from that in uninfected children. overall, these features show an immune system that closely resembles that of an uninfected child of similar age, making this child an ideal example of post-treatment hiv-1 control.the ability of this child to both control virus to levels below detection on standard assays and to control immune activation presents the best of both worlds; these features have been described separately for elite controllers18,55, non-pathogenic nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus infection and long-term non-progressing children56,57. events that may have led to sufficient silencing of virus replication will be explored by whole-genome sequencing of virus/provirus. further investigation will expand our understanding of how the immune system controls hiv-1 replication with accompanying low immune activation, and inform future strategies for art interruption and other interventions for hiv remission.methodsthe case and study participantsin the cher trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00102960; 2005–2011), hiv-1-infected treatment-naive, asymptomatic infants aged ≤12 weeks with a cd4% ≥25% were randomized to early limited art for 40 (art-40w; n = 143) or 96 (art-96w; n = 143) weeks or to deferred art (n = 125)23. in the art-40w group, 122 met criteria to stop art, together with 105 in the art-96w group. re-initiation of art was based on a cd4% decrease to <20% and on clinical criteria23. by the trial end, median follow-up was 4.9 years (iqr: 3.7–5.3). the child in this report was randomized to the art-40w arm. follow-up after the trial continued as part of pepfar-supported routine health services and later in an observational study58,59. cd4+ t cell counts were determined using the facscount system (bd biosciences, san jose, ca, usa).plasma hiv-1 rna levels were quantitated retrospectively on stored samples by roche ampliprep/cobas® taqman hiv-1 test, v2.0 (roche molecular systems, inc., branchburg, nj, usa) with a lower detection limit of 20 rna copies per ml (except for three time points where detection limits of assays used were 50 or 400 rna copies per ml).to gain further insight into specific characteristics of this case, detailed virological, immunological and genetic studies were undertaken at 9.5 years of age. some viral studies were conducted on stored samples from 50 weeks of age at art interruption. the mother is deceased and no stored maternal samples are available for study.for comparisons of immune cell phenotypes, we included samples from five healthy age-matched hiv-uninfected children (3 females, 2 males; median 9 years, range 9.5–10 years) and 10 hiv-uninfected adults (5 females, 5 males; median age 44 years, range 35–55 years) from the same population.ethics statementthe cher trial was approved by the ethics committees of the university of the witwatersrand and stellenbosch university. thereafter, the human research ethics committee of the university of the witwatersrand provided approval for all subsequent observational studies and investigations of the case. all participants provided written informed consent. for all minors, a parent or guardian gave written informed consent and the child gave written assent. we have complied with all ethical regulations.assays to detect hiv-1 dna and rnaan sn-qpcr assay targeting reverse transcriptase (rt) was developed for subtype c proviral dna quantitation based on methods of pasternak et al.60 and kiselinova et al61, and described in kuhn et al28. the sn-rt-qpcr is a two-step pcr in which the first round of amplification was carried out using conventional pcr and allowed to proceed for 15 cycles only and the total product of the first-round pcr was subsequently used in the second round of pcr, a real-time hydrolysis probe-based pcr using a fluorescently labelled taqman probe, one primer identical to the forward primer used in the first-round pcr and a second reverse primer designed to bind “deeper” within the amplicon. the second-round pcr was carried out for the standard cycle numbers used in real-time pcr (40 cycles). the numbers of hiv-1 proviral dna copies were determined by using the standard curve method. to construct the standard curve, known copies of linearized hiv-1 p8.mj4 plasmid dna were serially diluted and amplified in a background of hiv-1-negative human gdna (the same amount used in the experimental wells) and subjected to the same cycling conditions. sequences of primers and probe are as follows: first-round pcr, sn-rt-forward primer-1 5′-cat ttc ttt gga tgg ggt atg a-3′ and sn-rt-reverse primer-1 5′-cct gtt ctc tgc caa ttc taa ttc

gdna was extracted using the qiaamp dna blood kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). conventional pcr was performed using the roche expand high-fidelity (hifi) pcr system (roche diagnostics gmbh, roche applied science, mannheim, germany) and the qpcr was carried out using lightcycler 480 probes master mix (roche diagnostics). cycling conditions were standard for both expand hifi and taqman hydrolysis probe qpcr. at 9.5 years of age, a total of 9 µg of gdna extracted from isolated pbmcs (cell equivalent is 1.36 × 106 cells) was tested at an input of 1 µg per well. the standard curves were run in triplicate at each plasmid dilution, except for the 1 copy standard where five replicates were done. at 50 weeks of age, 3 µg of pbmc dna (cell equivalent is 4.54 × 105 cells) was tested.an in-house ultrasensitive n-qpcr, targeting the highly conserved integrase (in) gene designed using all subtype c sequences available on the los alamos hiv database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/), was used to detect subtype c hiv-1 dna and rna. briefly, the n-qpcr assay is a two-step pcr with the first pcr being a standard pcr allowed to proceed to end-point (30 cycles) using the roche expand hifi pcr system and the second pcr a hydrolysis probe real-time pcr using roche lightcycler 480 probes master mix. the total product generated in the first-round pcr is used in the second round. negative controls include both water and gdna or rna extracted from healthy hiv-1-uninfected donors. positive controls include gdna/rna extracted from known hiv-1-infected individuals. sequences of primers and probe are as follows, first-round pcr: n-in-forward primer-1 5′-tgg cag trt tca ttc aca att tta-3′; n-in-reverse primer-1 5′-tcc tgt cya cyt gcc aca caa tca-3′;

was extracted using the qiaamp dna blood kit (qiagen). rna was extracted from plasma or culture supernatant using the qiagen qiaamp viral rna kit. complementary dna was synthesized using the invitrogen superscript iii first-strand synthesis system for rt-pcr (thermo fisher scientific, ma, usa) and a combination of a gene-specific primer (reverse primer-1) and random hexamers. dnase treatment of extracted rna was carried out using the ambion turbo dna-free kit (thermo fisher scientific). cycling conditions were standard for both expand hifi and taqman hydrolysis probe qpcr.hiv-1 proviral gag sequencingthe near full-length hiv-1 gag gene encompassing partial p17gag coding regions to the gag stop codon was pcr-amplified from gdna isolated from cd4+ t cells using an in-house nested pcr assay. a first-round pcr amplification was performed using outer pcr primers gagoutf (5′-tgt taa aac act tag tat ggg caa g-3′) and gagoutr (5′-tta ctt tga taa aac ctc caa ttc c-3′) using the roche faststart hifi pcr system (roche diagnostics). a second-round pcr amplification was performed using a tenth volume of first-round pcr product and second-round pcr primers gaginf (5′-ttg cac tta acc ctg gcc ttt tag a) and gaginr (5′-att tat ttc ttc taa tac tgt atc atc tgc-3′). pcr products were purified using agencourt ampure xp magnetic bead separation (becton-dickinson, franklin lakes, nj, usa), cloned into pcr4-topo plasmid vectors (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) and transformed into escherichia coli bacteria. plasmid inserts were sequenced using bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing master mix (life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa) and eight sequence primers. the two inner pcr primers and six overlapping internal sequencing primers (gagsegf1: 5′-gct ctt cag aca gga aca ga-3′, gagsegf2: 5′-gga cat caa gca gcc atg ca-3′; gagsegf3: 5′-gaa gaa atg atg aca gca tg-3′; gagsegr1: 5′-cct gct atg tca ctt ccc ct-3′; gagsegr2: 5′-ttt cca cat ttc caa cag cc-3′; gagsegr3: 5′-ttt

were analysed using sequencher v4.5 software (gene codes corporation, ann arbor, mi, usa). a consensus sequence (supplementary fig. 1) was derived from sequencing multiple cloned gag fragments (genbank accession numbers: mh789553–mh789572), and viral subtype was determined by phylogenetic analysis with reference subtypes a–d using mega version 462.viral outgrowth assaysthe presence of replication-competent virus was assessed through two viral outgrowth assays with modifications63. cd4+ t cells isolated from a stored sample of the case at 50 weeks of age (2 × 106 cells) and from a fresh sample at 9.5 years (2 × 106 cells) were activated with phytohemagglutinin (pha) (5 µg ml−1) for 2 days in media supplemented with il-2 (20iuml−1; roche diagnostics), washed and added to pha-stimulated cd8-depleted pbmcs (4.0 × 106 cells) from a healthy hiv-1-uninfected donor (with high ccr5 expression as determined by flow cytometry) or 3 × 105 molt4/ccr5 cells. culture supernatants were tested for hiv-1 p24 by elisa (alliance kit, perkin elmer life sciences inc., uk). for increased sensitivity, the n-qpcr was used to detect hiv-1 rna in pooled and pelleted supernatant samples. molt4/ccr5 cells (cat. no. 4984) were obtained through the nih aids reagent programme, naiad, nih from dr. masanori baba, dr. hiroshi miyake and dr. yuji iizawa64.infection of cd4 t cells in vitrothe child’s cd4+ t cells were tested for permissiveness to infection by hiv-1 bal. cd4+ t cells (1 × 106 cells) from the child were activated with pha (5 µg ml−1) in media supplemented with il-2 (20 iu ml−1) for 2 days, and then inoculated with hiv-1 bal (~10 ng p24; ccr5-tropic virus; 2 h, 37 °c co2 incubator). pha-stimulated cd8-depleted pbmcs from a healthy hiv-1-uninfected donor (high ccr5 expression) as well as 3 × 105 molt4/ccr5 cells infected with ~10 ng p24 hiv-1 bal were included as positive controls. supernatants were harvested and quantitated by p24 elisa. hiv-1 bal was from dr. suzanne gartner, dr. mikulas popovic and dr. robert gallo65 (cat. no. 510, nih aids reagent programme, division of aids, niaid, nih).measurement of hiv-specific antibodiesthe presence of hiv-1-specific antibodies in plasma was determined by gs hiv-1 western blot (bio-rad laboratories, inc., usa), by elisa (genescreen ultra ag/ab; bio-rad laboratories) and a microsphere-based array assay (bio-rad). hiv-1 antigens were covalently conjugated onto carboxylated magnetic fluorescent beads (bio-plextm magnetic cooh beads; 1.25 × 107 beads per ml; bio-rad) using a standard two-step carbodiimide coupling procedure (luminex map® technology66). briefly, the stock suspension of beads was vortexed at high speed to disperse bead aggregates and an aliquot of beads (1.25 × 106) was transferred to a coupling reaction tube, washed with dh2o and resuspended in activation buffer (0.1 m nah2po4, ph 6.2), followed by the addition of 50 mg ml−1 of n-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (pierce, rockford, il, usa) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa) and incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. activated beads were washed with coupling buffer (50 mm mes, ph 5.0) and resuspended with antigen (5–6.25 µg) to a final volume of 500 µl with 50 mm mes, ph 5.0, for 2 h, in the dark at room temperature. after incubation, the beads were washed twice with storage/blocking buffer (pbs-tbn: phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (bsa), 0.02% tween-20, 0.05% sodium azide), counted using a haemocytometer and stored in the dark at 4 °c.hiv-specific immunoglobulin isotypes were detected by preparing a microsphere mixture comprising the seven hiv antigen-coupled beads (gp41, gag, rt, gp120, nef, tat, vpu, peptide vpu9 and v1v2 scaffold; supplementary table 4). to each well of a 96-well flat bottom greiner plate (bio-rad), 50 µl of working microsphere mixture prepared in assay buffer (pbs, 1% bsa; 2500 beads from each bead region per well), 40 µl assay buffer and 25 µl of patient plasma (diluted 1:75 in assay buffer) was added. following an incubation period (on a shaker in the dark at room temperature; 2 h), the plate was washed three times with wash buffer (pbs, 0.1% bsa, 0.05% tween-20) with a final wash in assay buffer. hiv-specific antibody isotypes were detected by adding 50 µl per well at 2 µg ml−1, r-phycoerthyrin-conjugated mouse anti-human igg1 to igg4 (cat. nos 9052-09, 9070-09, 9210-09, 9200-09, respectively, southern biotech, usa), mouse anti-human igm (cat. no. 9020-09, southern biotech), mouse anti-human iga1 (cat. no. 9130-09, southern biotech) or mouse anti-human iga2 (cat. no. 9140-09, southern biotech) with shaking (in the dark at room temperature) followed by three washes. beads were finally resuspended in bio-rad sheath fluid and analysed using the bio-plex 200 instrument (bio-rad) by measuring the fluorescence signal for 50 beads per analyte. background signal, defined as the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) for each microsphere set when incubated with pe detection ab in the absence of patient plasma, is subtracted from the fluorescent intensity of each sample. the cut-off for seropositivity for each analyte is calculated as the average mfi value from pooled plasma from hiv-1-uninfected patients plus 3 standard deviations. hiv-ig (cat. no. 3957; nih aids reagent programme) served as a positive control on each plate and the mfi values tracked with a levy–jennings plot.intracellular cytokine assayshiv-1-specific t cell (cd4+, cd8+) and nk cell responses were measured using a whole blood intracellular cytokine assay (ifn-γ and il-2) stimulated with overlapping hiv-1 subtype c synthetic peptides in pools representing gag, pol, nef, env, tat, rev, vif, vpu and vpr proteins. briefly, 200 µl of whole blood, collected in sodium heparin, was stimulated with a final concentration of 10 µg ml−1 of peptide (synthesized as 15–18 mers overlapping by 10 amino acids, with the exception of nef, which overlaps by 11 amino acids, nmi, germany) together with 1 µg of the costimulatory antibodies cd28 and cd49d (cat. nos 340975 and 340976, respectively, bd biosciences) and the transport inhibitor brefeldin a (10 µg ml−1; sigma-aldrich). positive controls were stimulated with 1 µg/ml seb (cat. no. s4881, sigma-aldrich) for t cells or with 5 ng ml−1 anti-cd16 antibody (clone ebiocb16, cat. no. 16-0168-85, ebioscience, san diego, ca, usa) for nk cells. the latter measures reverse adcc, therefore providing a measure of the capacity of nk cells to perform adcc through engagement with fcγriiia/cd16a receptors. to monitor spontaneous cytokine release, the equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide, as in the peptide tubes, together with the costimulatory antibodies was prepared. samples were incubated for 6 h at 37 °c, after which they were maintained at 18 °c overnight. twenty microlitres of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) was added for 15 min, following which red blood cells were lysed for 10 min at room temperature using 2 ml facs lysing solution (bd biosciences). facs permeabilizing solution (500 µl; 15 min; room temperature; bd biosciences) was added to centrifuged samples which were washed twice before staining with cd3 percp (clone sk7, cat. no. 345766, 5 µl), cd8 fitc (clone sk1, cat. no. 347313, 5 µl), cd4 bv786 (clone l200, cat. no. 563914, 0.8 µl), cd56 apc (clone ncam16.2, cat. no. 341025, 5 µl of a 1:16 dilution), il-2 phycoerythrin (pe) (clone 5344.111, cat. no. 340450, 10 µl) and ifn-γ pe (clone 25723.11, cat. no. 340452, 5 µl) for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. stained cells were acquired using a 4-laser bd lsrfortessatm x-20 flow cytometer (bd biosciences) and analysed (gating strategy in supplementary fig. 2) using the flowjo software (tree star inc., ashland, or, usa).multiparameter flow cytometrywhole blood immunophenotyping by multicolour flow cytometry (to determine proportions of naive/memory cd4+ and cd8+ t cell subsets) included measures of ccr5 expression (density and %), immune activation (hla-dr) and immune exhaustion (tigit and pd-1). the following antibodies were used, in three antibody panels: cd3 apc-h7 (clone sk7, cat. no. 560176, 2 µl), cd8 percp (clone sk1, cat. no. 347314, 6.5 µl), cd8 alexa fluor 700 (clone rpa-t8, cat. no. 557945, 2 µl), cd4 bv786 (clone l200, cat. no. 563914, 0.8 µl), cd4 fitc (clone sk3, cat. no. 347413, 6 µl), ccr5 pe (clone 2d7, custom 1:1 conjugated antibody, 10 µl), ccr7 fitc (clone 150503, cat. no. 150503, 6.5 µl), cd45ro bv510 (clone uchl1, cat. no. 563215, 4 µl), cd62l pe-cf594 (clone dreg-56, 1.6 µl), pd-1 bv786 (clone eh12.1, 3.3 µl) were obtained from bd biosciences. tigit apc (mbsa43, cat. no. 562301, 1.6 μl) was obtained from ebioscience, hla-dr pe-cy5.5 (clone tu36, cat. no. mhldr18, 1.6 µl) was obtained from life technologies and cd95 bv605 (clone dx2, cat. no. 305628, 6.5 µl) was obtained from biolegend (san diego, ca, usa). the ccr5 antibody was conjugated to pe at a ratio of 1:1, and quantitation (density measured as antibodies bound per cell) was carried out using the quantibrite system (bd biosciences). whole blood (100 μl) was incubated with the antibodies at room temperature, in the dark, for 15 min. thereafter, red blood cells were lysed using facs lysing solution (bd biosciences). samples were then washed and resuspended in facsflow. stained cells were acquired on a 4-laser bd lsrfortessatm x-20 flow cytometer (bd biosciences) and analysed (antibody panels and gating strategies in supplementary fig. 3-5) using the flowjo software (tree star inc.).host genotypinghla class i and ii and kir genotyping was conducted on gdna extracted from blood cells (qiaamp dna blood mini kit, qiagen). the sequence-based typing resolver kits (conexio genomics, fremantle, australia) were used to generate hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, drb1, dpb1 and dqb1 amplicons for dna sequencing as described by the manufacturers. the exons included for dna sequencing are: exons 1–4 for hla-a and hla-b; exons 1–8 for hla-c; exons 2 and 3 for hla-drb1 and hla-dqb1; exons 1–5 for hla-dpb1.the presence or absence of the 16 kir genes (14 functional and 2 pseudogenes 2dp1 and 3dp1) were determined using allele-specific (as) primers (supplementary table 5) in a real-time pcr assay67. briefly, pcr reactions were performed in a 5 µl volume, containing 2× maxima sybr green/rox qpcr master mix (fermentas, burlington, on, canada), 0.2 µm of kir-specific primers, 0.2 µm of galactosylceramidase-specific primers and 5 ng of dna. thermocycling was performed using the applied biosystems 7500 real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) under the following conditions: 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 1 min, with subsequent melt-curve analysis.published primers and probe specific for kir2ds4 full-length (f; *001) or truncated (v; *003,004,006,007,009) alleles68 and kir3dl1/s169 were used in combination with the primers and probe specific for the human β-globin (bgb) reference gene70 (supplementary table 6) in a probe hydrolysis-based relative quantification real-time allele-specific (as)-pcr assay to determine gene copy number variation (kir2ds4 and kir3dl1/3ds1). to facilitate target and reference gene multiplexing, kir-specific probes were labelled at the 5′ end with the fluorochrome vic, while bgb probes were labelled with the fluorochrome fam. control samples of known gene copy numbers were run concurrently with unknowns and gene copy numbers inferred using a delta ct method (difference between ct values obtained for kir and bgb genes). all samples were run in duplicate. real-time as-pcr amplification was performed in 96-microwell pcr plates using an abi7500 real-time pcr instrument (life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa). reaction volumes were 5 µl containing 5 ng of genomic dna, 2× lightcycler 480 probes master mix (roche), 0.5 µm kir3dl1/s1 or kir2ds4f/v forward/reverse primers (inqaba biotec, pretoria, rsa), 0.5 µm bgb forward/reverse primers (inqaba biotec, pretoria, rsa), 0.1 µm vic-labelled kir3dl1/s1 or kir2ds4f/v probe and 0.1 µm fam-labelled bgb probe (life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa). cycling conditions were an initial incubation of 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, 55 °c for 10 s and 60 °c for 30 s.

In-depth validation of total HIV-1 DNA assays for quantification of various HIV-1 subtypes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35403-6,Research,22 November 2018,yes,"hiv-1 dna quantification serves as an important reservoir biomarker in hiv cure trials. however, the high genetic diversity of hiv-1 represented by different subtypes may bring inaccuracy in quantifying hiv-1 dna and a sensitive and validated assay covering diverse hiv-1 subtypes is lacking. therefore, we cross-validated total hiv-1 dna assays described in literature using a three-step comparative analysis. first, a bioinformatics tool was developed in-house to perform an in silico evaluation of 67 hiv-1 dna assays. secondly, these selected assays were in vitro validated using a panel of different hiv-1 subtypes and, finally, ex vivo assessed on selected patient samples with different hiv-1 subtypes. our results show that quantification of hiv-1 dna substantially differs between assays and we advise five best performing hiv-1 dna assays for ddpcr and qpcr (schvachsa_2007, viard_2004, heeregrave_2009, van_der_sluis_2013, yu_2008 and yun_2002). this in-depth analysis of published hiv-1 dna assays indicates that not all assays guarantee an optimal measurement of hiv-1 dna, especially when looking across subtypes. using an in-depth cross-validation, we were able to validate hiv-1 dna assays that are suitable for quantification of hiv-1 dna in a wide variety of hiv-1 infected patients.
introduction total hiv-1 dna in hiv-1 infected patients is increasingly being recognized as a valuable marker for hiv cure efforts, but also for current clinical follow-up. upon infection, hiv-1 integrates into the human genome where it can remain dormant as proviral dna in infected cells and thereby avoiding eradication by antiretroviral therapy (art). this impedes an hiv cure because the reservoir of latently infected cells can fuel viral rebound when art is interrupted1. to date, different hiv cure strategies are being explored in order to reduce or limit the establishment of the viral reservoir, and in this context, total hiv-1 dna is increasingly being used as a marker for the size of the viral reservoir2,3. furthermore, the role of hiv-1 dna quantification is also being explored in treatment simplification strategies as virological control under monotherapy has been correlated to a lower level of total hiv-1 dna compared to patients who failed protease inhibitor monotherapy3,4,5. this suggests that total hiv-1 dna is a promising predictive factor for treatment stratification in hiv-1 infected patients. lastly, precise hiv-1 dna quantification is essential for early hiv diagnosis of infants born to hiv-positive morthers6. as illustrated, total hiv-1 dna is established as a relevant marker but inaccuracy in the quantification can arise from the high genetic heterogeneity of hiv-1 that is reflected by the various hiv-1 strains and subtypes among patients and the high variation of sequences within patients. in western countries the hiv-1 subtype b is dominant and many described hiv-1 dna assays are focused on the quantification of this subtype7. however, more detailed knowledge about their performance in quantifying hiv-1 dna across all hiv-1 subtypes is necessary in order to contribute to hiv cure trials worldwide. for that reason, there is a growing need to invest in identifying a uniform total hiv-1 dna assay that is able to accurately quantify different hiv-1 subtypes to be used in a global clinical setting. here, we present a three-step comparative analysis of already published hiv-1 dna pcr assays. first, a bioinformatics tool was designed to compare hiv-1 dna assays described in literature, subsequently the assays were further assessed on cells infected with panel of hiv-1 viruses, and lastly a comparison was made using relevant patient material from individuals infected with various hiv-1 subtypes.resultsselection of total hiv-1 dna assays and in silico prediction analysisa total of 3627 articles were scanned in search of pcr-based assays used for quantification of total hiv-1 dna in patients (fig. 1a). as a result, 67 hiv-1 dna assays were analyzed in silico by using the in-house developed bioinformatics tool (fig. 1b, supplemental table s1). the 5 top ranked assays were selected and complemented with additional 13 hiv-1 dna assays that were frequently cited (≥6 citations) in literature (fig. 2). in addition, two assays were included for the validation of the tool, i.e. novitsky_2006, due to a substantial impact of the number of allowed mismatches for the probe on its ranking (supplemental fig. s1) and soares_2006 due to a low ranking based on the bioinformatics tool. in total, 20 hiv-1 dna assays were selected for further evaluation.figure 1schematic representation of

dna assays on a panel of hiv-1 subtypes by ddpcrin total, 30 samples were analyzed, five per hiv-1 subtype (hiv-1 a, b, c, d, crf01_ae and crf02_ag) by the 20 selected assays (fig. 1c, fig. 3). the capability to quantify hiv-1 dna of different subtypes varied greatly between assays. in agreement with the in silico data, soares_2006 only picked up minimal hiv-1 dna sequences from various subtypes. multiple assays such as koelsch_2011, yukl_2010, novitsky_2006 were able to amplify hiv-1 subtype b, but underperformed with other subtypes, in particular hiv-1 subtypes crf01_ae and crf02_ag. besson_2012 was able to quantify hiv-1 dna efficiently but was unsuccessful in capturing hiv-1 dna from subtype c. six assays (schvachsa_2007, viard_2004, heeregrave_2009, van_der_sluis_2013, yu_2008 and yun_2002) were able to capture more than 70% of the hiv-1 dna in >90% of the samples with varying hiv-1 subtypes. two out of these six (schvachsa_2007 and viard_2004) were able to capture more than 90% of hiv-1 dna in >90% of the samples across all hiv-1 subtypes.figure 3validation of a panel of hiv-1 subtypes. heatmap of hiv-1 dna assays analyzed on dna of a panel

(*) dna samples restricted with restriction enzyme xhoi instead of ecori prior ddpcr quantification.full size imagehiv-1 dna assays in patient samples (ddpcr and qpcr)the six best assays were selected for subsequent in-depth analysis in hiv-1 infected patient samples. here, hiv-1 dna was quantified by ddpcr in 91 hiv-1 positive patients, categorized in thirteen different hiv-1 subtypes (table 1, fig. 1d, fig. 4, supplemental table s2). all assays were able to capture on average 90% of the maximally measured hiv-1 dna (schvachsa_2007: 94.2%, viard_2004: 93.0%, yu_2008: 93.3%, van_der_sluis_2013: 92.8%, yun_2002: 92.7% and heeregrave_2009: 88.5%). additionally, the performance of these assays were analyzed on the qpcr platform in 87 patient samples (table 1, fig. s2, supplemental table s3). correspondingly, the hiv-1 dna assays were able to amplify around 90% of the maximally measured hiv-1 dna (schvachsa_2007: 90.0%, viard_2004: 93.3%, yu_2008: 93.7%, van_der_sluis_2013: 88.5%, and yun_2002: 91.4%) except heeregrave_2009 which had an average of 73.5%.table 1 validation of 6 selected hiv-1 assays on patient samples selected based on their hiv-1

considerations: restriction enzymes and ltr-region of hiv-1 genomeas restriction enzymes are often used in ddpcr workflows to ensure gdna digestion and proper encapsulation of gdna into droplets, commonly used restriction enzymes were evaluated on hiv-1 dna fragmentation by in silico predictions of target cut sites within the hiv-1 genome (supplemental fig. s2). ecori was selected for enzymatic restriction of samples for all hiv-1 dna assays. however, ecori cuts in the amplicon of assays claiborne_2015 and soares_2006 in respectively 33.54% and 6.46% of the hiv-1 sequences of the los alamos database (supplemental fig. s3). therefore, additional samples were restricted with restriction enzyme xhoi for the quantification by the two above mentioned assays. however, no substantial difference in hiv-1 dna quantification was observed by the selection of the restriction enzymes for those two assays (fig. 3). furthermore, the target amplicon of assay vandergeeten_2014 and chun_2005 is located solely in the ltr-region of hiv-1 genome. due to the two ltr regions present in the hiv-1 genome, these assays measure up to a twofold overestimation of number of hiv-1 dna copies (supplemental fig. s4). therefore, for these assays a correction factor of 1/2 was applied.discussion a validated hiv-1 dna assay that can reliably and accurately quantify different hiv-1 strains in patient derived samples is a prerequisite for the applicability of total hiv-1 dna as a biomarker of hiv-1 reservoir in clinical care and experimental hiv cure trials. various pcr-based total hiv-1 dna assays and approaches have been described in literature8,9,10,11,12. however, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the published assays has not been done yet. our literature search indicated that more than 60 different assays for quantifying total hiv-1 dna are being used in studies with patient samples in the last 2 decades. this raises the concern about comparing quantitative data between different laboratories.since a wet-lab validation of this large amount of assays is costly, we opted to implement a data analysis pipeline for the initial in silico comparison of assays. our results show that this tool provides a rough estimate of the true performance of the assays. but nonetheless, a subsequent wet-lab validation of assays remains the essential step of the validation process. the strength of the tool lies in the comprehensive analysis of primers and probes together and the ability to allow a limited number of primer and probe mismatches. at present, too little data is available to quantitatively assess the assay performance on specific mismatches as the effect of mismatches depends on the specific base-pairs13, the neighboring base pairs14,15 and the position on the primer or probe14,15. future studies aiming to quantitatively assess this issue may enable a further fine-tuning of our pipeline. additionally, this type of data analysis pipeline is not limited only to the hiv field. it is therefore designed in an open-source platform and allows for the analysis of assays of other viruses or organisms with high variable genomes.the initial wet-lab validation of the panel of 5 different hiv-1 subtypes indicated that there are large differences in total hiv-1 dna quantification between these assays. this hampers data comparison between results from different studies and may result in biased conclusion s. it is important to note here that some assays were intended for a specific subtype and/or set of patients16,17,18,19, whereas other assays were validated on multiple subtypes20. however, implementation of these assays in patients with unknown subtypes of different subtypes of the ones initially designed for may lead to misleading data where results will most probably underestimate hiv-1 quantification. a pan-hiv-1 assay is preferable since hiv-1 subtypes are not always known, and pan-hiv-1 assays are less refractory to variability within subtypes or patients.accurate hiv-1 dna quantification of patient samples is highly challenging because of the low abundance of hiv-1 dna in patients suppressed with art and the viral heterogeneity within this patients. therefore, the six selected assays were tested on patient samples, selected based on their hiv-1 subtype, by ddpcr and qpcr. data generated from the hiv-1 infected patients confirm the data from the hiv-1 panel. on ddpcr, all assays where able to pick up around 90% of the percentage of hiv-1 dna copies in relation to the assay with the most detected copies (88.63–94.25%) and have a similar performance. some samples have a relative value of 0 (blue in fig. 4 and supplemental fig. s5) but these can be explained by a general low concentration of the hiv-1 dna present in that particular sample indicating that the effect of sampling variation may have caused these results21. the adequate performance from these assays was confirmed by data generated on the qpcr platform. however, for qpcr the performance of heeregrave_2009 drops to an average of 72.9%. for the qpcr platform, primer/probe mismatches can cause detrimental effect on pcr efficiency and lead to an underestimation of the true hiv-1 dna level13. for ddpcr, mismatches between primer/probe and target dna or inhibitory substances cause a drop in the fluorescence of the droplets and leads to droplets with an intermediate fluorescence22,23. but these droplets with intermediate fluorescence can remain quantifiable in the ddpcr22.there are some limitations associated with this study. in the literature search, some assays may have been missed due to a non-availability of full-texts or assays published after july 2016. furthermore, the bioinformatics tool has its restrictions. a number of mismatches of the probe still permits efficient amplification, but only minimal information is available on the influence of the location of these mismatches, which lead to the simplification of the tool where a varying 0 to 3 mismatches were allowed for the probe. various primers and/or probe had degenerative nucleotides, this could be considered as a mismatch in disguise and could skew the ranking. additionally, the performance of the tool depends on the quality of database: for some hiv-1 subtype only a few representative sequences were available and the 3′end of the sequences in the hiv-1 database is often truncated: assays located in the 3′ end of the hiv-1 genome (3′-ltr) were only assessed on a fifth of the total amount of sequences in the hiv-1 database. however, the bioinformatics tool allows to use a viral database of choice.overall, this study highlights the limitation of comparing results between studies using different assays for hiv dna quantification and the importance of identifying a validated hiv-1 dna assay that accurately measures total hiv-1 dna for its further implementation in hiv-1 clinical trials. since pcr-based hiv dna quantification has a good inter-laboratory reproducibility3,24, a validated assay will allow the comparison of results between different clinical studies and different laboratories but good standards will be necessary for validation of the method, especially for qpcr which requires an stable external calibrator25. lastly, a precise quantification of hiv-1 dna can guide the selection of patients participants in hiv-1 cure studies and early diagnosis of infants of seropositive mothers. we do want to point out that while digital pcr is a good quantification method for hiv dna load, it is not an optimal technique for early diagnosis of hiv since low level of false positive droplets cannot be excluded26. furthermore, the 5′-ltr and 3′-ltr within one hiv genome can be separated due to fragmentation or restriction digest, and incorporated into two different droplets. thereafter, hiv dna quantification could lead to a twofold overestimation if the used assay is located exclusively in the ltr region. ample amount of assays are described in literature, but to our knowledge, a cross-validation of assays has not been performed before. this type of validation enables expansion of cohorts to patients infected with non-b hiv-1 subtype, and include a varied group of patients with different background and hiv-1 subtypes.finally, we hereby declare that the study was performed without any personal or financial bias towards any described assay.materials and methodssystematic literature searchto obtain a comprehensive list of frequently used hiv-1 dna assays, a systematic literature screening was performed using pubmed and web of science databases (fig. 1a). articles were included that describe quantification of hiv-1 dna, total hiv-1 dna and hiv-1 reservoir in the context of patient samples for the period between 1st of january 1992 and 1st of july 2016. the following search terms were used: (hiv or hiv-1 or human immunodeficiency virus) and (((quantitation or quantification or total) dna) or reservoir)) (human or humans or patient or patients). the inquiry was further refined by excluding reviews and limited to articles written in english. all remaining articles were pooled and duplicates were removed. subsequently, availability of the full-text of the articles was checked which led to a database of 3627 articles. this set of articles was manually evaluated with following exclusion criteria: (1) quantification of non-virological markers or other viruses than hiv-1; (2) quantification in non-patient samples such as in vitro or animal experiments; (3) quantification of other virological markers such as long terminal repeat (ltr) circles, hiv-1 rna, integrated hiv-1 dna; (4) patient-specific or resistance-related assays; (5) total hiv-1 dna assays lacking a hydrolysis probe and (6) total hiv-1 dna assays with a publicly unavailable sequence. since we aimed at validating assays that are compatible for the most commonly used platforms: droplet digital pcr (ddpcr) and real-time pcr (qpcr), (7) assays using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology were further discarded. for further validation of nested pcr approaches, the inner primer pair and probe were selected and assays consisting of multiple primers/probes in one reaction were divided in single sets of primers (forward and reverse) and a single probe.in silico analysis of hiv-1 dna assays using an in-house designed bioinformatics toolto analyze the theoretical performance of the assay, a bioinformatics analysis pipeline was developed in r language (fig. 1b, script available upon request)27. in this bioinformatics tool, assays consisting of a set of primers and a probe are matched to a database of hiv-1 sequences. for our analysis, a comprehensive database of hiv-1 sequences was extracted from the hiv los alamos national laboratory website (www.hiv.lanl.gov)28. since the database is incomplete in some hiv-1 dna regions, assay-specific databases were constructed based on the subsampling of sequences that had a complete sequence annotation in the region of the primers and probes. alignment of matched primers and probes was performed on the assay-specific database, and hits were only recorded when both the primers and probe matched to a particular sequence. to enable comparison of different assays, the total number of hits was divided by the total number of sequences in the assay specific database. as pcr is to some extent refractory to primer/probe mismatches, the tool can allow a certain number of mismatches. here, up to maximum 3 mismatches for the primers and a varying maximum 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches for probe was allowed. however, we corrected for specific deleterious mismatches that are likely to block the reaction completely14,15: (1) five or more mismatches in the forward and reverse primer combined; (2) mismatch in the first 3′-end nucleotide when additional mismatches occurred in one of the four consecutive nucleotides and (3) two consecutive mismatches in the first five 3′-end nucleotides in the primers were not allowed. furthermore, the score was weighted based on the global prevalence of the different hiv-1 subtypes to correct for misrepresentation of specific subtypes in the database (e.g. overrepresentation of hiv-1 subtype b)29. sequences of primers and probes of all assays are summarized in supplemental table s1.assay optimization for droplet digital pcr (ddpcr) and qpcrbased on the bioinformatics tool and complemented with assays frequently described in literature, a selection of 20 hiv-1 dna assays was chosen to perform wet-lab validation (fig. 1c,d). pcr protocols were optimized for each of the selected hiv-1 dna assays on the droplet digital pcr qx200 (bio-rad) and qpcr lightcycler® 480 (roche applied science) by performing a temperature gradient pcr to select assay-specific annealing/elongation temperatures (supplemental table s1).comparison of selected hiv-1 dna assays on a standardized hiv-1 subtype panelvirus stocks, cell culture, infection and sample processingan initial validation was performed by ddpcr on a panel of hiv-1 viruses obtained from the national institutes of health (nih) (panel of 60 international hiv-1 isolates, cat# 11412,30). this panel consists of viral hiv-1 isolates of persons infected by subtype a, b, c, d and circulating recombinant forms (crf), crf01_ae and crf02_ag. to generate dna sequences in vitro, infection was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy donors or mt-4 depending on the hiv-1 tropism (r5 or x4) of the viral isolates. briefly, 200 µl of virus was added to 3 × 106 cells and after spinoculation (900 g, 90 min, 32 °c) kept in culture at 5% co2 at 37 °c. after 7 days of culture, cells were harvested and stored as a dry-pellet of 107 at −80 °c. to confirm successful infection, an aliquot of supernatant was assessed by the retroviral reverse transcriptase (rt) assay31.total hiv-1 dna quantification by droplet digital pcrfive distinct viruses per hiv-1 subtype (hiv-1 a, b, c, d, crf01_ae and crf02_ag) were analyzed by ddpcr (total of 30 samples). total genomic dna (gdna) was isolated from 107 cells using dneasy blood & tissue kit (qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. dna was eluted in 100 µl elution buffer and kept at 56 °c for 10 min to maximize the dna yield. next, gdna was restricted by ecori or xhoi, (restriction enzyme selection described in supplement; ecori for all assays, extra samples restricted by xhoi for claiborne_2015 and soares_2006) with the use of 12.98 µl gdna in a total volume of 15 µl of restriction mix. the ddpcr mix was made by adding 2 µl of sample to 10 µl of 2x ddpcr supermix for probes (bio-rad), 500 nm of primers and 300 nm of probe (integrated dna technologies) in a final volume of 20 µl. samples were measured in duplicate. the pcr protocol consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 30 s denaturation and assay-specific annealing/elongation temperature (supplemental table s1) for 60 s with a ramp rate of 2.5 °c/s, and completed by an enzyme deactivation step of 98 °c for 10 min. droplets were read by the qx200 droplet reader (bio-rad) and samples were quantified with the ddpcrquant software22. graphically representation by heatmap was performed with the pheatmap package (version 1.0.8) in r27. as we cannot make an absolute estimation of the total hiv-1 dna per sample, for each sample the concentration of hiv-1 dna copies from an assay was divided by the output of the assay that quantified the largest amount of hiv-1 dna within the same sample. this led to a value, called ‘relative quantification’, between 0 and 1: a result diverging to 0 (0%) (depicted in blue in fig. 2) means that only a few hiv-1 dna copies were picked up by the assay compared to the most sensitive assay, whereas a number close to 1 (100%) (red in fig. 2) stands for a well performing reaction. due to the fact that their target amplicon is solely located in the ltr region of hiv-1, for vandergeeten_2014 and chun_2005 a correction factor of 1/2 was applied (supplemental data).comparison of selected assays on hiv-1 infected patient samplesbased on performance of the hiv-1 dna assays on the hiv-1 isolates panel, 6 assays were selected for further validation on patient samples by ddpcr and qpcr. after obtaining written letters of informed consent, hiv-1 infected patients were selected and enrolled based on their hiv-1 subtype at the aids reference center, ghent university hospital, ghent, belgium. the study was approved by the ethics committee of ghent university hospital (reference number: b670201317826) and the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. from 91 patients (table 1), blood was drawn in six 9 ml edta tubes and pbmcs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation with lymphoprep (elitech group). aliquots of 107 pbmcs were stored in freezing media (fetal calf serum + 10% dmso) at −80 °c. total gdna was isolated as described earlier and eluted in 75 µl elution buffer. total hiv-1 dna was measured by ddpcr as described previously. the reference gene rpp30 was measured to correct for cell input32. normalized hiv-1 dna copies were expressed as log10 hiv dna/106 pbmcs. assays were ranked based on the average of the percentage of hiv-1 dna copies in relation to the assay with the most detected copies. based on the availability, 87 samples were additionally measured by qpcr (table 1, described in supplement).

Proteo-Transcriptomic Dynamics of Cellular Response to HIV-1 Infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36135-3,Research,18 January 2019,yes,"throughout the hiv-1 replication cycle, complex host-pathogen interactions take place in the infected cell, leading to the production of new virions. the virus modulates the host cellular machinery in order to support its life cycle, while counteracting intracellular defense mechanisms. we investigated the dynamic host response to hiv-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic expression changes in infected and uninfected supt1 cd4+ t cells at five time points of the viral replication process. by means of a gaussian mixed-effects model implemented in the new r/bioconductor package tmixclust, we clustered host genes based on their temporal expression patterns. we identified a proteo-transcriptomic gene expression signature of 388 host genes specific for hiv-1 replication. comprehensive functional analyses of these genes confirmed the previously described roles of some of the genes and revealed novel key virus-host interactions affecting multiple molecular processes within the host cell, including signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, and immune system. the results of our analysis are accessible through a freely available, dedicated and user-friendly r/shiny application, called peachi2.0. this resource constitutes a catalogue of dynamic host responses to hiv-1 infection that provides a basis for a more comprehensive understanding of virus-host interactions.
introduction upon cellular invasion of the host t-cell, the success of hiv-1 infection depends on numerous virus-host interactions. during the roughly 24-hour-long replication cycle, hiv-1 enters the host cell, integrates its genome, and utilizes the host cellular machinery in order to produce new virions. the host genes that are utilized by the virus to support its lifecycle are called hiv dependency factors (hdfs)1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. conversely, the host cell defense system tries to counteract infection through innate immune cellular responses, attempting to block different stages of the replication cycle. the host genes involved in these defense responses are called hiv inhibitory factors (hifs) and include virus-specific restriction factors10,11,12,13.several studies have investigated virus-host interactions and identified dependency and inhibitory factors, based on sirna experiments1,2,3,4,5,8,9,14, proteomic assays6,7,15, and functional screens16,17. most of these analyses were focused on one type of omics data, either transcriptomics or proteomics, at a single time point. only a few studies investigated hiv-host interactions with a temporal resolution18,19,20. in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of virus-host interactions over time, we explored virus-induced cellular reprogramming at multiple molecular levels and time points. a series of high-resolution, genome-wide measurements of the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome were conducted in uninfected and infected supt1 cd4+ t cells in order to define the dynamic, integrated proteo-transcriptomic response of the cell to infection with an hivegfp vector and to understand the key molecular players maintaining a balance between host support for viral replication and host defense response to inhibit infection (fig. 1). for this purpose, we built on previous work and used a well-established supt1 experimental cellular system18.figure 1experimental design overview. supt1 cd4+ t cells were cultured in a heavy (13c6-l-lysine, 13c615n4-l-arginine) or light isotope culture medium, respectively. cells were either mock-infected, or infected with an hiv-gfp-based vector. at different time points, cells were collected for viral intermediate measurements and for omic (transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome) measurements. the dynamic interplay of host-hiv interactions was investigated at the three different molecular levels, aiming at identifying novel putative host factors modulated during hiv replication. ms: mass spectrometry.full size imageusing a clustering approach that we implemented in the r/bioconductor package tmixclust, we identified expression signatures specific to hiv-1 infection, corresponding to novel putative host factors involved in hiv replication. functional analysis of these genes provided insight into how the virus modulates key host molecular processes to assure completion of its replication cycle. our results constitute a unique resource, presenting for the first time a temporal analysis of hiv infection jointly at three different omics levels, namely, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome. the data and results are freely accessible through an online catalogue allowing users to inspect and use them for future research, available at https://peachi2.shinyapps.io/peachi2/.resultsanalysis of hiv replication dynamicssupt1 cd4+ t cells were either mock-infected or infected with an hivegfp-based vector. virus-host interactions were characterized over time by multiple time series measurements (fig. 1). as described previously18, the infection conditions allowed for quasi universal infection. through an initial quantitative analysis, levels of viral intermediates - early and late reverse transcription (rt) products, integrated viral dna, viral translation (gfp expression), and viral particle release (p24 release) - were evaluated every 2 h during 24 h to ascertain successful infection and follow hiv replication cycle advancement (fig. 2). consistent with our previous analysis18, we observed a prevalence of early and late reverse transcription products corresponding to the reverse transcription stage peaking at ~10 h post infection. reverse transcription was followed by the integration stage indicated by a peak of integrated viral dna at ~18 h. finally, emergence of viral translation and viral particle release during 18–24 h post infection signaled the final stage of the viral replication cycle (fig. 2). analysis of joint virus-host omics data was performed every 6 h at the transcriptome level via rna-seq, and at the proteome and phosphoproteome levels via mass spectrometry (ms), quantifying total viral rna, protein production, and phosphorylation events over time (supplementary figs s1 and s2). the viral transcript and protein production measurements over time from the virus-host omics data were consistent with the quantitative analysis of hiv replication progression through viral intermediate measurements (fig. 2). precisely, a considerable increase in viral transcripts and protein products after 18 h was observed, delineating the final stage of the viral replication cycle.figure 2hiv replication cycle progression. (upper panel) schematic representation of the hiv-1 replication cycle illustrating the major steps of hiv progression. (lower panel) relative quantification of viral intermediates, transcription and protein synthesis normalized by the 24 h time point and depicting the three key stages of hiv life cycle: reverse transcription, integration and late phase. viral intermediate measurements consist of multiple viral dna forms, i.e. early and late reverse transcription products (early rt, late rt) as well as integrated viral dna measured by qpcr, expression of the virally encoded gfp protein measured by facs (geometric mean fluorescence intensity), and viral particle production measured by p24 elisa of the supernatant. total viral transcription was quantified by the rna-seq reads which were aligned to the hiv genome. total viral protein expression was quantified by mass spectrometry.full size imagequantification of omics measurements in hiv- and mock-infected supt1 cellsrna-seq yielded on average 108 million raw sequencing reads per sample. after read trimming and quality filtering, we obtained an average of 102 million aligned reads per sample, including uniquely aligned reads and multimapper reads. in each sample, over 90% of the reads were uniquely mapped to the concatenated human plus hiv reference sequence (supplementary table s1, supplementary fig. s3a). the number of reads mapping to the hiv genome increased with time, and was significantly correlated with viral translation (pearson correlation ρ = 0.97, pearson correlation test: p = 0.03) and with viral particle release (pearson correlation ρ = 0.99, pearson correlation test: p = 0.007), consistent with hiv life cycle progression (supplementary fig. s3b). following transcriptome profiling and filtering, hiv versus mock rna expression changes at five time points were obtained for 13,057 genes (supplementary file s1, supplementary table s2). principal component analysis of hiv and mock rna-seq gene expression read counts resulted in a clear separation between hiv and mock samples, as well as a temporal ordering of the hiv-infected samples (fig. 3a).figure 3overview of the time series omics quantification of mock and hiv-infected supt1 cells. (a) principal component analysis for hiv and mock gene expression profiles obtained from rna-seq. each data point corresponds to the ensemble of gene expression rna-seq read counts for a corresponding time point and condition (either mock or hiv-infected). the time-points are indicated next to each data point, specifying whether the corresponding sample is a mock (grey circles) or hiv-infected (green squares) sample. non-infected samples (mock) cluster together and separate from the hiv-infected samples which are consistently distributed according to their time after hiv-infection. (b) venn diagram representing the numbers of detected, filtered genes at rna, protein, and phosphoprotein levels, as well as the overlap of detected genes between these levels.full size imagefollowing silac ms data analysis, we detected 4,947 proteins and 2,072 phosphorylation sites corresponding to 793 proteins (supplementary table s2). after processing and filtering, hiv/mock time series protein expression profiles were obtained for 3,613 proteins and 1,111 phosphorylation sites corresponding to 590 proteins (supplementary table s2, supplementary file s1). we observed a similar temporal ordering of the protein and phosphoprotein samples in a principal component analysis of the log2(hiv/mock) protein and phosphoprotein ratios (supplementary fig. s4).in total, 3,455 genes had measurements at both rna (out of 13,057 transcripts, corresponding to 26.5%) and protein (out of 3,613 proteins, corresponding to 95.6%); 568 genes had measurements at all three levels (fig. 3b).proteo-transcriptomic temporal analysis of the host cell upon hiv-1 infectiondifferential expression analysis between mock and hivegfp-infected conditions was performed initially regardless of the time point (cf. methods) and resulted in 1506 differentially expressed genes, 415 differentially expressed proteins, and 157 differentially expressed phosphorylation sites, corresponding to 125 proteins with a differential phosphorylation status (supplementary fig. s5, supplementary file s2). using a gaussian mixed-effects models framework, we modeled the changes in expression of the differentially expressed genes through time and clustered the genes at each omics level based on their temporal profiles (cf. methods). we implemented the model in the dedicated r/bioconductor package tmixclust. for each data type (rna, protein, and phosphoprotein), stability and silhouette analyses indicated that the number of gaussian model components, or clusters, that provided the optimal segregation with the largest average silhouette width was two (supplementary figs s6–s9). further investigation of the time series behavior in each cluster revealed a global upregulation and downregulation expression pattern for each data type (supplementary fig. s10). we found 1073 upregulated and 433 downregulated genes at the rna level, 206 upregulated and 209 downregulated proteins, and 24 upregulated and 133 downregulated phosphorylation sites corresponding to 20 and 100 unique genes, respectively (supplementary file s3).the results of the clustering analysis define the proteo-transcriptomic expression response patterns of host genes to hiv-1 infection. these patterns and their underlying data are available in an r/shiny application providing a user-friendly querying platform, coined peachi2 (patterns of expression and analysis of clusters of hiv/host interactions v2.0), accessible at https://peachi2.shinyapps.io/peachi2/. on this platform, users can specify the desired proteo-transcriptomic behavior (up- or downregulation patterns at the three data levels) and retrieve the corresponding genes, as well as inspect the behavior of custom gene lists and download the associated data (supplementary fig. s11).we functionally characterized the differentially expressed genes in terms of gene set enrichment in reactome pathways21, as well as in a curated library of gene sets associated to hiv-related processes, available at18 (supplementary file s4). the enriched reactome pathways were stratified into functional categories according to the first layer of the reactome hierarchy of pathways21. a separate category, named “hiv”, represented the above-mentioned library of hiv-related gene sets. the differentially expressed genes involved in these functional categories were further assessed according to their identified infection-specific patterns of up- and downregulation, leading to a comprehensive image of how host gene expression is modulated during hiv infection at multiple molecular levels (fig. 4). we observed a pronounced upregulation response at the rna level, for the most part involving signal transduction pathways, as opposed to the other two omics levels. our data suggest that hiv-1 influences the signaling mechanisms of infected cells mainly by affecting expression of cell surface receptors, chemokine receptors, g-protein-coupled receptors, or genes involved in signaling of rho gtpases (supplementary file s5), recapitulating previous findings22,23,24,25. at the protein and phosphoprotein levels, the identified differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in pathways describing immune system, metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, and hiv-related processes (fig. 4, supplementary file s5).figure 4enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. differentially expressed genes identified at rna, protein and phosphoprotein levels were analyzed in terms of enrichment in reactome pathways, as well as in hiv-related pathways included in a separate collection. enriched reactome pathways were grouped according to the reactome hierarchy into enriched categories, while the hiv-related pathways were assigned to a separate category called “hiv”. category names are specified on the left side of the figure. each circle size (pathway count) is proportional to the number of enriched pathways included in the corresponding category. the color of each circle (significance) reflects the log10 of the geometric mean of the corrected p-values for the pathways included in each category. next to each circle, the barplot displays the percentages of upregulated and downregulated genes in the corresponding category.full size imagefour genes were found differentially expressed at all three omics levels, specifically the histone gene hist1h1b, cytoskeleton protein lima1, transcription factor tfap4, and the uracil dna glycosylase ung (supplementary fig. s12). although the exact roles of these genes throughout the hiv replication cycle are insufficiently understood, their interactions with viral genes have been reported by previous studies. with a putative role in adjusting nucleosome structure and chromatin organization during hiv-1 infection, hist1h1b has been shown to interact with hiv proteins gag and tat26,27. co-immunoprecipitation assays have identified interactions between lima1 and viral protein tat28. downregulation of tfap4 at protein level observed in our data has also been previously reported19. finally, it has been shown that hiv gene vpr induces ung degradation during hiv infection29,30, supporting its observed downregulation in our data.based on their protein up- or downregulation behavior, host genes were nominated as putative host factors which are modulated during hiv replication (supplementary file s6). table 1 and fig. 5 summarize the observed proteo-transcriptomic patterns associated to these factors.table 1 proteo-transcriptomic patterns putatively associated to host factors involved in hiv replication.full size tablefigure 5time series patterns specific to putative host factors regulated during hiv replication. two distinct patterns of protein expression behavior may define candidate host factors involved in hiv replication: 192 upregulated proteins (upper panel) and 196 downregulated proteins (lower panel). gene expression dynamics of these factors differs between rna and protein levels. each line corresponds to a time series expression of a single gene at rna and protein levels. the box plots display the gene expression distributions at each time point for rna (orange) and protein (blue).full size imagewe first assessed to what extent our detected putative factors reproduce previous well-known hiv-host interactions. for this reason, a list of 3,743 previously reported host genes presumably involved in hiv-1 replication was established by including reported candidates from published studies. in this list, we included genes reported in sirna screens1,2,3,5,8,16, protein assays6,7,15, or genome-wide analyses9,31 (supplementary table s3, supplementary file s7). we observed a statistically significant overlap between this list and our selected candidate factors. more precisely, 57 upregulated (29.7%) and 73 downregulated factors (37.2%), corresponding to a total of 130 out of 388 (33.5%) candidate factors were previously reported as being involved in host cell gene expression modulation during hiv replication (hypergeometric test: p < 10−47, supplementary file s7). among these, we recovered well-known, hallmark cellular genes involved in virus-host interactions, such as the surface receptor cd432, the transcription regulator nfkb133, the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk934, the vpr-binding protein vprbp35, and the uracil dna glycosylase ung36. in addition to the previously reported factors, our time series proteo-transcriptomic analysis identified new genes, including dead-box helicases, zinc-finger proteins, and kinesins, potentially involved in hiv replication, that have not been described in this role before (supplementary file s6). the peachi2 online resource allows retrieving all the identified candidate factors and studying their behavior at the three omics levels.enrichment analysis of the selected upregulated and downregulated host proteins revealed the functional layers of the host cellular machinery that are perturbed during hiv infection. precisely, these proteins were found enriched mainly in pathways associated to hiv, metabolism, cell cycle, immune system, and gene expression (supplementary fig. s13, supplementary file s8). moreover, approximately 14% of the downregulated proteins consisted of nucleolar and ribosomal proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. their observed downregulation behavior has also been reported in previous studies and associated to hiv mechanisms of controlling host protein synthesis, ultimately inducing apoptosis at late stages of viral replication37. enriched immune responses differed between the two categories of factors. while upregulated proteins were enriched in pathways mainly consisting of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i and ii presentation, toll-receptor cascades and cytokine signaling, downregulated proteins were enriched in pathways containing four innate immune genes (cnpy3, ppp2r5d, casp2, and cd4) as well as genes involved in cd28 family co-stimulation, ctla-4 inhibitory signaling, tcr signaling, and translocation of zap70 to the immunological synapse (supplementary file s8). regulatory changes within these pathways during hiv infection have been reported in previous studies as well38,39,40,41. furthermore, the immune system gene cd4 was among the reported downregulated factors, in agreement with its well-known interaction with the viral protein nef that downregulates cd432.the majority of genes in both factor classes exhibited differential expression behavior at the protein level but not at the rna level, suggesting direct modulation of these host proteins by hiv (fig. 5, supplementary file s6). such examples include the transcription factors tcf7 and lef1 which were not found differentially expressed at the rna level, but downregulated at the protein level. this behavior is consistent with direct inhibition at the protein level of the wnt/β-catenin pathway during hiv replication, as reported previously42,43. conversely, only 13% upregulated and 13.3% downregulated factors were differentially expressed at both levels (table 1). among these were four immune system genes with consistent behavior at rna and protein levels: upregulated lcp2, and downregulated gna15, kif20a, and trim36. lcp2 (lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2) is involved in tcr-mediated intracellular activation and was shown to favor hiv replication following sirna functional studies1,44. furthermore, it has been shown that the hiv envelope protein upregulates lcp245. these previously reported results are concordant with the observed upregulation behavior in our data, at rna and protein levels. gna15, a g protein subunit, and kif20a, a kinesin protein, were not reported so far to be involved in the hiv replication cycle. in contrast, trim36, a tripartite family member, was shown to be downregulated by the viral protein vif. however, the exact role of trim36 remains to be elucidated.time series host phosphoproteomic characterization during hiv-1 infectionwe found 157 differentially expressed phosphorylation sites between hiv- and mock-infected conditions, corresponding to 125 unique phosphorylated proteins (supplementary table s2) involved in host molecular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle, metabolism, and gene expression (fig. 4, supplementary file s5). out of these, 24 sites presented increased phosphorylation (21 unique proteins) and 133 sites were down-phosphorylated (113 unique proteins). only 22 of the differentially phosphorylated proteins were also found differentially expressed at rna and protein levels (supplementary file s9).few studies have analyzed the host phosphoproteomic modulation during infection with hiv15,19 and little is known about the regulation of the host gene phosphorylation by hiv. wojcechowskyj et al. have performed a phosphoproteomic screen during hiv-1 entry and have identified 175 differentially phosphorylated proteins and validated 37 of them through sirna-induced depletion15. their study brings forward and demonstrates the importance of serine/arginine-rich proteins for hiv-1 splicing. our time series phosphoproteomic data recovers 21 out of the 175 differentially phosphorylated proteins found by their analysis, with 7 of them being among the ones validated by their sirna experiments (supplementary file s9). these include serine/arginine-rich proteins acin1 (apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer 1) and pnn (pinin).in another study of phosphoproteome regulation during hiv infection, greenwood et al. show that the viral protein vif induces degradation of ppp2a phosphatase family members by phosphorylation19. among the differentially phosphorylated proteins within our time series data, we have found members ppp1r12c and ppp4r2 of the protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, suggesting that hiv affects the family of phosphatases to a larger extent. with role in cytoskeleton assembly, ppp1r12c was found upregulated at protein level and downphosphorylated, while ppp4r2, involved in dna repair, was found unchanged at protein level and downphosphorylated, with marginal downregulation at rna level. it has been previously shown that knocking down ppp1r12c constrains early viral replication steps2.the transcription factors tcf3 and tfap4 were found differentially phosphorylated in our data. both factors were phosphorylated and downregulated at the protein level. this behavior can either suggest that phosphorylation might be required for degradation of the protein, or that phosphorylation independently affects the activity of the protein. downregulation and degradation of tcf3 reiterate the afore-observed inhibition at the protein level of the wnt/β-catenin pathway during hiv replication through downregulation of proteins tcf7 and lef1. while the phosphorylation of tcf7 and lef1 could not be quantified due to our limit of detection, phosphorylation of tcf3 may suggest that hiv potentially inhibits the wnt/β-catenin pathway by inducing phosphorylation of its members. the transcription factor ap4 (tfap4), known to inhibit hiv transcription46, was found downregulated at the protein level in our data as well as by a previous proteomic analysis19. however, our data shows for the first time that, while tfap4 is downregulated at the protein level during hiv infection, the phosphorylation status of the protein is upregulated.the ensemble of 157 identified differentially phosphorylated proteins in our study can be retrieved and visualized on the peachi2 platform and constitutes a useful resource for analyzing the regulation of post-transcriptional modifications during hiv infection. however, it remains to be determined how hiv triggers up- or downphosphorylation of these proteins, as well as the roles of these phosphorylated proteins within the viral replication cycle.discussion most studies investigating on a large scale how hiv influences the host cell during infection considered so far the cellular transcriptome at a single time point, with little attention to protein and phosphoprotein changes. although very useful, these analyses do not capture virus-specific post-transcriptional cellular regulation and cannot identify the influence of the virus on the host cells at the protein level47. recent development and increasing resolution of proteomic technologies have led to new insights in characterizing virus-host interactions at the proteome and phosphoproteome level48. in the present work, we employed both transcriptome and proteome high-throughput screening and reported host and virus transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic abundances in mock- and hivegfp-infected t cells at consecutive time points of the viral replication cycle. successive additional measurements of several viral intermediates tracing the hiv replication cycle advancement correlated with viral transcriptome and proteome dynamic quantification and delineated the time course and the main stages of the replication cycle. on the cellular host side, by clustering time series expression profiles at the three levels, we were able to identify host genes involved in hiv replication, based on their displayed protein upregulation or downregulation expression patterns. the identified temporal patterns have been compiled into an interactive resource, peachi2, describing the proteo-transcriptomic responses of a host immune cell to hiv infection.integrating proteo-transcriptomic gene expression dynamic profiles revealed 388 host genes with putative roles in hiv replication, corresponding to 192 upregulated host proteins and 196 downregulated host proteins. over 33.5% of the identified factors have been previously reported, in support of our findings. of note, gene expression changes induced by hivegfp could be attributed either to hiv or to gfp expression, as it was not possible to dissociate gfp impact in the current experimental setting. while our study recapitulated well-known virus-host interaction factors, such as cd4, cdk9, nfkb1, or ung, it also revealed numerous novel factors which have not been described before. these new candidate factors are involved in a wide range of molecular processes, such as signaling, immune response, cell cycle, gene expression, or metabolism. the majority of these factors were not found differentially expressed at the rna level. this may indicate, on one hand, direct induction or inhibition by hiv at the protein level, arguing for a multi-omics approach. on the other hand, it is possible that low changes in rna expression for the majority of these genes, which were not considered significant by our analysis, may trigger stronger response at the protein level. furthermore, noise levels, technical biases across omics technologies, as well as limit of detection at the protein level, may contribute to this effect. in contrast, hiv-mediated modulation of genes at all the three omics levels - such as for the four genes identified here, lima1, hist1h1b, tfap4, and ung - may suggest a critical role of these genes in the hiv life-cycle. a quick, strong, and long-term response needed for these particular genes throughout the viral life-cycle could justify the need of such a multi-targeted strategy.silac proteomic measurements presented inferior detection compared to transcriptome quantification. only 26.5% of the genes detected at the rna level were also measured successfully at the protein level, and only 4% were quantified at all three omics levels. furthermore, the phosphoproteomic measurements contained a large amount of missing values and noise, and consequently could not be used for identifying proteo-transcriptomic expression signatures of infection. furthermore, because phosphoprotein measurements needed to be adjusted by their protein expression in order to remove an existing abundance bias in silac data49, a large number of phosphoproteins could not be assessed due to lack of quantification at the protein level. alternatives to silac, such as tandem mass tagging (tmt), could be attractive as they may yield a better coverage and especially less missing data in time series19. also, combining quantifications from different proteomic techniques may increase the number of genes detected at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, and lead to more rigorous quantifications.time series expression profiling of the host cell during hiv-1 infection allows describing how the host gene expression is modulated through time in response to viral infection and replication. specific temporal transcriptomic expression patterns associated to different stages of the replication cycle have been previously described with high-resolution time series analyses18. our data consists of short time series (5 sampled time points per gene), which allows detection of global up- and downregulation patterns in response to infection. however, due to the relatively small number of time points and increased variability, our data is not suited for a more fine-grained stratification of expression patterns, capable for example of distinguishing early from late differential regulation. a superior number of equally distant time points, such as for example the design used in18, would be necessary to capture these changes robustly, as they would be supported by more than one consecutive time point.hiv can impact the host cell at multiple levels. to alter the expression of genes at different omics levels, the virus disposes of a multitude of strategies. for example, it can affect transcription rates of genes, target rna or protein degradation directly, or modulate enzyme activity involved in post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. through a multi-omics time series analysis of the host t cell gene expression, our work broadens and refines the landscape of hiv-host interactions. the different temporal expression patterns of the genes may reflect the diverse strategies of how hiv modulates host cell content. while offering a more detailed view of the host response to hiv infection, the presented analysis constitutes an initial step towards understanding the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. the identified host candidates require further validations and more targeted functional analyses in order to understand their precise role and interactions with hiv. peachi2 offers a reliable resource for investigating and selecting candidates for follow-up analyses. finally, studying how interfering with these interactions affects hiv replication success may provide new insights for developing novel treatment strategies.methodsviral infection of t-cells and sample collectiona population of 500 × 106 supt1 cells (lymphoblastic t cell line) was cultured in rpmi 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs) (invitrogen) (fig. 1). isotope-labeled amino acids (13c6-l-lysine, 13c615n4-l-arginine, cambridge isotope laboratories (cil), andover, ma) were included in the heavy (h) silac medium at 100 mg/l, while normal arginine and lysine were used in the light (l) silac medium. heavy or light silac labeling was achieved by culturing the cells in the two media (h and l) for a minimum of 2 weeks to allow for at least 5 cell divisions. h-labeled cells were mock infected, while the l-labeled cells were infected with an hivegfp/vsv-g virus at 3 μg/106 cells. infection (both mock and with an hivegfp vector) was carried out by spinoculation for 30 min at 1500 g in presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene. as previously described18, this allowed reaching a quasi-universal infection. cells were then washed and further incubated. the hivegfp viral vector used expresses gfp instead of the viral protein env. at multiple time points post-infection, cells were collected and processed for analysis of hiv life cycle progression and normalized by the 24 h time point as in18, as well as for transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome as detailed below (supplementary file s10).rna-seqtotal rna extraction was performed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, and 30 h after mock and hivegfp infection. the illumina truseq protocol was used for preparing the mrna-seq library and cluster generation (100 nt, single end), followed by high-throughput sequencing performed on the illumina hiseq2000 sequencer at the genomics technology facility of the university of lausanne. a replicate experiment was performed for the 24 h time point for both hiv and mock conditions.silac mass spectrometry protein and phosphoprotein experimentsat 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h post mock and hiv infection, cells were lysed by pulse sonication in 8 m urea, 50 mm tris ph 7.5 and phos-stoptm phosphatase inhibitors (roche). clarified heavy and light extracts were quantitated and mixed 1:1. proteins were reduced by incubation with 5 mm dtt and alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide, then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid/deoxycholate. pellets were resuspended in 8 m urea, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate by sonication and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (1:50) overnight at 37 °c. digests were desalted on sep-pak c18 cartridges, and lyophilized. for total proteome analysis, digests were separated into 12 subfractions by peptide isoelectric focusing as previously described50. for phosphopeptide enrichment (i.e. peptide with phosphorylation site as a surrogate for phosphorylation status), aliquots of 1.0 mg of unfractionated digests were dissolved in loading buffer (80% acetonitrile, 5% tfa, 1 m glycolic acid) and incubated with 6 mg of titanium dioxide beads (5 μm, gl sciences) for 10 min. the resin was washed 3x with 500 μl loading buffer, 2x with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% tfa. a second elution was performed and analyzed separately. phosphopeptides were eluted with 100 μl of 1% ammonium hydroxide and the eluate was immediately acidified with 1% tfa. peptides were desalted on poros oligo r3 beads, dried and analyzed by lc-ms/ms. dried peptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile. samples were analyzed on a hybrid linear trap ltq-orbitrap velos pro mass spectrometer (thermo fisher, bremen, germany) interfaced via a nanospray source to a dionex rslc 3000 nanohplc system (dionex, sunnyvale, ca, usa). peptides were separated on a reversed-phase acclaim pepmap nanocolumn (75 μm id × 25 cm, 2.0 μm, 100 å, dionex) with a gradient from 5 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid in 120 min). full ms survey scans were performed at 60,000 resolution. all survey scans were internally calibrated using the 445.1200 background ion mass. in data-dependent acquisition controlled by xcalibur 2.1 software (thermo fisher), the twenty most intense multiply charged precursor ions detected in the full ms survey scan were selected for collision-induced dissociation (cid) fragmentation in the ltq linear trap with an isolation window of 3.0 m/z in multi-stage activation mode (exciting the precursor and the neutral loss simultaneously) and then dynamically excluded from further selection during 120 s.bioinformatics data analysis and statistical modeling of time series omics datarna-seq data processingillumina adapter sequences were removed from rna-seq reads using cutadapt v1.7.151. reads were then filtered using prinseq-lite52 which removed their poly-a and low-quality (quality score less than 6) boundaries and kept for further analysis only the reads longer than 30 nucleotides and with a mean quality score larger than 20. the fastqc software53 was used for quality assessment of the datasets. sequencing reads were aligned using star v2.554 to the grch38 human genome assembly concatenated to the hivegfp/vsv-g hiv genome sequence (supplementary file s11). a standard way to construct the concatenated human/hiv genome is to add hiv as an extra chromosome to the human genome. this allows for a correct and unbiased mapping of the reads18. the number of reads aligned to each gene was retrieved at each time point with htseq-count v0.5.355 with option –inverse, using the ensembl genome annotations for human and hiv56 (supplementary file s12). the read counts per gene were normalized using the median-of-ratios method introduced with the deseq tool57. genes with average read count less than 100 reads in both conditions (hiv-infected and mock-infected) were filtered out and the gene read counts were smoothened by adding a pseudo-count of 10 reads. afterwards, log2(hiv/mock) fold changes were computed for each gene at each time point (supplementary file s1).normalized relative production of total hiv reads was obtained at each time point by calculating the proportion of the hiv reads out of the total number of aligned reads at each corresponding time point (supplementary file s10). relative production was then obtained by adjusting the fractions to the 24 h time point.principal component analysis of the gene expression read counts in all the rna-seq samples was used to initially explore the gene expression profiles for hiv-infected and mock-treated samples over time.mass spectrometry silac data processingmass spectrometry data from protein and phosphoprotein experiments were analyzed and quantified using maxquant v1.3.0.5 (2013 release). the human subset of the release 2013_07 of the uniprotkb database was used (www.uniprot.org). a separate database was constructed, containing all sequences of hiv proteins and used in parallel. cleavage specificity was trypsin (cleavage after k, r) with two missed cleavages. initial mass tolerances were of 4.5 particles per million (ppm) (after recalibration) for the precursor and 0.5 da for cid tandem mass spectra. protein and phosphopeptide identifications were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (fdr) established by maxquant against a reversed sequence database. common contaminants and hits against reverse sequences were filtered out. light/heavy (l/h) ratios were normalized and the log2(hiv/mock) fold changes at all time points were calculated. only proteins with measurements supported by more than 2 peptides at a minimum of two consecutive time points were considered for further analysis. as suggested in49, the phosphoprotein ratios were normalized by their corresponding protein ratios in order to remove the bias in the phosphoprotein measurements introduced by the protein relative abundance. therefore, only phosphoproteins with available protein measurements were considered for the analysis. principal component analysis was used to explore the profiles of log2(hiv/mock) ratios at protein and phosphoprotein levels over time.normalized relative production of total hiv protein expression was calculated using the intensity-based absolute quantification (ibaq)58 retrieved from the silac ms experiment for the viral proteins. at each time point, total hiv protein ibaq expression was divided by the total ibaq expression from all the proteins, in order to obtain the fraction of the proteome constituted by the hiv proteins (s10 file). the fractions at each time point were further adjusted by the last time point, resulting in relative production of total hiv protein over time.differential expression analysisan approach based on the distribution of relative expression changes between conditions(hiv-infected and mock) as described in59 was employed for differential expression analysis. accordingly, a z-score threshold of 2 standard deviations was applied to the distribution of gene log2(hiv/mock) fold changes at each level (rna, protein, and phosphoprotein) and time point. a gene was considered differentially expressed between mock and hiv-infected conditions if, at least at one time point, its log2(hiv/mock) fold change was at least two standard deviations beyond the mean of the fold changes at the corresponding time point, i.e., had an absolute z-score greater than 2 at least at one time point (supplementary fig. s5).gaussian mixed-effects model for identifying time series gene expression patternsbased on their log2(hiv/mock) time series profiles, differentially expressed genes were clustered using a gaussian mixed-effects model as introduced in60 (see the supplementary information for a detailed description of the model). the clustering model was implemented in the r/bioconductor package tmixclust and is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tmixclust.html. of note, we could not assess the variability of individual time point measurements due to the limited number of replicates. however, since measurements at consecutive time points are considered to be correlated, an increased number of time points is usually preferred over the availability of replicates61. our statistical model is designed to capture smoothness of expression between time points and time series with highly variable behavior between consecutive time points would yield an unstable clustering result and would consequently be discarded.we repeated the clustering procedure 50 times in order to avoid local optima and to identify the clustering configuration with the highest likelihood. we employed the distribution of the rand index62 for the 50 separate clustering runs, quantifying the agreement between the different clustering solutions and the solution with the highest likelihood, in order to assess the stability of the clustering. after stability analysis for different numbers of clusters k = 1, …, 5, the distribution of the silhouette coefficient (or silhouette width)63 for each number of clusters was used to select the number of clusters that best fits the data. more precisely, the number of clusters that resulted in a clustering configuration with the largest average silhouette width was chosen.clustering analysis with tmixclust was applied to the time series observations of the differentially expressed genes at each data level (rna, protein and phosphoprotein) separately. we characterized the overall temporal gene expression pattern of each resulting cluster per data type by comparing, for the ensemble of genes in each cluster, the distribution of their hiv/mock expression throughout time to the baseline. an upregulated behavior was defined if the average temporal expression profile of the genes in a cluster was increasing and above the baseline, while a downregulation behavior corresponded to an average temporal expression profile of the genes in a cluster which was decreasing and below the baseline (supplementary fig. s10). the results of the clustering analysis were organized and made available through the peachi v2.0 r/shiny resource available at https://peachi2.shinyapps.io/peachi2/.enrichment analysisenrichment analysis was performed using the reactome pathways21, downloaded from msigdb64, and a set of manually curated hiv-specific gene sets published in18. for each gene set, enrichment was tested through a hypergeometric test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple testing and a significance threshold for the corrected p-values of 0.05. the background gene list for the enrichment tests consisted of the ensemble of 47,339 overall expressed genes at least at one level (rna, protein or phosphoprotein). the hierarchical structure of the reactome pathways21 was used to assign enriched gene sets to major functional categories and to construct an enrichment summary.

HIV-1 vaccination by needle-free oral injection induces strong mucosal immunity and protects against SHIV challenge,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08739-4,Research,18 February 2019,yes,"the oral mucosa is an attractive site for mucosal vaccination, however the thick squamous epithelium limits antigen uptake. here we utilize a modified needle-free injector to deliver immunizations to the sublingual and buccal (sl/b) tissue of rhesus macaques. needle-free sl/b vaccination with modified vaccinia ankara (mva) and a recombinant trimeric gp120 protein generates strong vaccine-specific igg responses in serum as well as vaginal, rectal and salivary secretions. vaccine-induced igg responses show a remarkable breadth against gp70-v1v2 sequences from multiple clades of hiv-1. in contrast, topical sl/b immunizations generates minimal igg responses. following six intrarectal pathogenic shiv-sf162p3 challenges, needle-free but not topical immunization results in a significant delay of acquisition of infection. delay of infection correlates with non-neutralizing antibody effector function, env-specific cd4+ t-cell responses, and gp120 v2 loop specific antibodies. these results demonstrate needle-free mva/gp120 oral vaccination as a practical and effective route to induce protective immunity against hiv-1.
introduction human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) is most commonly transmitted across genital and rectal mucosal surfaces via sexual contact1. within the first days and weeks of infection, hiv-1 is localized to the mucosal tissue, replicating in resident target cells, before systemic dissemination and seroconversion2. in addition, irrespective of the route of infection, hiv causes a rapid and profound depletion of cd4 t cells in the gut3. because of this, genital and gut mucosal immunity against hiv-1 is crucial in combating the virus in this early state. mucosal vaccination, in which immunizations are delivered directly to the mucosal tissues, are the most effective method of generating mucosal immunity4. while mucosal vaccines for hiv-1 have been investigated in non-human primate models, few human clinical trials have evaluated mucosal hiv-1 vaccination, and mucosal responses have rarely been characterized in previous clinical trials4,5.oral vaccines are attractive as they can induce strong immunity in the gut, are relatively non-invasive, and can be administered on a large scale4. oral vaccines generally are ingested and thus must survive the hostile acidic environment of the stomach to be sampled by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt) mainly in the distal regions of the small intestine. an alternative strategy of oral vaccination is to directly target the tissues within the oral mucosa for antigen delivery. vaccination of the oral mucosa, primarily to the buccal (inner cheek) and sublingual (below the tongue) tissue, has been proposed to be a practical, safe, and non-invasive route of mucosal vaccination6,7. the sublingual and buccal (sl/b) tissues contain numerous subsets of antigen-presenting cells, however these populations have not been fully characterized in humans and non-human primates8. most sublingual and buccal vaccinations are performed by the topical application of vaccines to oral tissues, allowing for natural absorption across the oral epithelium. the oral mucosa, unlike the simple columnar epithelium in the small intestine, consists of multilayered squamous epithelium, which can limit the natural uptake of vaccine antigens. thus, oral vaccination approaches that enhance vaccine uptake may significantly increase vaccine responses.to aid in antigen uptake, needle-free injectors can be used to deliver vaccines across the skin or oral epithelium into the underlying tissue, while retaining the non-invasive features of oral vaccination9,10. needle-free injectors have been investigated as a tool to deliver drugs and vaccinations, primarily through the skin, and are an attractive alternative to needle-stick based injections which carry disadvantages such as the need for trained health-care workers to administer injects, the risks associated with needle-sticks and re-using needles, as well as the common fear of needles resulting in reduced patient compliance10,11,12.here we evaluate the sl/b tissue as a route of needle-free oral hiv-1 vaccination in rhesus macaques. vaccine components are delivered orally to the sl/b tissues via either needle-free injection (needle-free sl/b) or topical application (topical sl/b) and compared to the conventional intradermal/subcutaneous route (id/sc) commonly used for needle-based immunizations. vaccinations consist of two priming immunizations with modified vaccinia ankara (mva) engineered to express hiv-1 antigens (mva-hiv) followed by boosting twice with a recombinant trimeric gp120 immunogen (cycp-gp120), along with the escherichia coli derived mucosal adjuvant double mutated heat-labile enterotoxin (dmlt), which has been shown to promote mucosal immune responses13. mva-hiv has been extensively characterized in non-human primate studies and is currently being tested in human clinical trials as an hiv-1 vaccine candidate14,15,16, and cycp-gp120 has previously been shown to elicit tier-2 neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs as well as promote highly-cross reactive v1v2-directed antibodies, a major correlate of protection in the rv144 trial, in rabbits and rhesus macaques17,18,19. to test the vaccine efficacy of mva-hiv/cycp-gp120, animals are challenged intra-rectally 19 weeks after the last immunization with a heterologous, pathogenic, difficult to neutralize shiv-sf162p3. needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunization both results in a significant delay in acquisition of infection compared to unvaccinated controls, with non-neutralizing antibody effector functionality and env-specific cd4 t-cell responses being the predominant correlates of protection. these results demonstrate that oral needle-free delivery of mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 vaccination induces a strong antibody response in mucosal and systemic compartments with protective potential against hiv-1. they also describe a novel method of needle-free vaccination that is practical and induces a strong antibody response in three major mucosal sites and serum.resultsdendritic cells in the sublingual and buccal tissueswhile antigen-presenting cells in the sublingual and buccal tissue (sl/b) have been described for mice and humans8, they have not been characterized well in rhesus macaques. langerhans cells (lcs) are a major subset of the migratory dendritic cells in the epidermis and have multiple roles in inducing immune responses, from maintaining immune homeostasis to activation and presentation of antigens upon inflammation20,21. to determine the presence of lcs in the sublingual and buccal tissue, we stained paraffin-embedded sections of rhesus macaque sublingual and buccal tissue with hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) to characterize the overall architecture of the oral epithelium and underlying tissue (fig. 1a), and performed immunohistochemistry with an anti-langerin antibody (fig. 1b). lcs could be detected in both sublingual and buccal tissue, primarily residing in the mucosal epithelium, confirming the presence of these cells within the oral tissue of rhesus macaques. to further characterize dendritic cell subsets in the sublingual and buccal tissue, we prepared single cell suspensions from biopsied samples and analyzed via flow cytometry. antigen-presenting cells were first gated as hla-dr+cd45+cd3−cd20−live cells (supplementary figure 1). in both the sublingual and buccal tissue, we detected a population of cd14+dc-sign+ dendritic or macrophage-like cell (dermal dcs)20,22 (fig. 1c). additionally, we detected conventional bdca1+ myeloid dendritic cells (cdcs) (cd14−cd16−cd123−bdca1+), but only low levels of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) (cd14−cd16−cd123+bdca1−) which may only be present during inflammation8. conversely, we detected much greater levels of pdcs present in the submandibular and submental lymph nodes that drain oral tissue. these lymph nodes also contained both dermal dcs and cdcs, though at a lower proportion to the buccal and sublingual tissue (fig. 1c). interestingly, we found the buccal tissue contained a significantly higher proportion of both cdcs (bdca-1+cd123−) and dermal dcs (cd14+dc-sign+), compared to the sublingual tissue. these data show there is a diverse population of antigen-presenting cells in the sl/b tissue and the local draining lymph nodes. our efforts to stain for lcs using flow cytometry were not successful likely due to poor binding of the antibody in this setting.fig. 1dendritic cells in the sublingual and buccal (sl/b) tissue of rhesus macaques. paraffin-embedded sublingual and

metabolite, retinoic acid, is important for generating gut-homing adaptive immune responses23,24. dendritic cells process vitamin a to retinoic acid via retinal dehydrogenase (raldh) enzymes25,26, the activity of which can be detected using the aldefluortm kit (stemcell). we characterized the expression of raldh enzymes by the apcs in the sublingual and buccal tissues as well oral mucosa draining lymph nodes using the aldefluortm reagent and flow cytometry. we found the raldh activity in both bdca1+cd123− cdcs and cd14+dc-sign+ dermal dcs present in the submandibular and submental lymph nodes, however this activity was not found in dcs within the sublingual and buccal tissue themselves (fig. 1d). however, it is possible that raldh activity may be induced in tissue dc upon activation as we showed previously following ad5 vaccination in mice25. taken together, these data demonstrate that the oral mucosa contains multiple antigen-presenting cell subsets with predominance of lcs, bdca1+ dc and cd14+dc-sign+ dc, and the draining lymph nodes contain gut-homing induction potential, indicating the oral mucosa is a viable route for mucosal vaccination.nhp study designto test if needle-free delivery of vaccines to the sl/b mucosa enhances the humoral immunity, we used the syrijet mark-ii needless injector (keystone industries), designed for use in dentistry to inject local anesthesia to the oral mucosa27 to deliver mva-hiv and protein vaccines to rhesus macaques (fig. 2a). first, we injected a rhesus macaque with 100 μl of sterile pbs and visualized the injection site before and after injection (fig. 2b). the syrijet injected effectively into both the sublingual and buccal tissue with minimal damage and bleeding, and no additional swelling or damage was reported in the following days post injection.fig. 2sl/b immunization with a needle-free injector induces strong systemic antibody responses. a syrijet, the needle-free injector used to deliver immunizations to the

dmlt. animals were immunized via topical application to the sublingual and buccal (sl/b) tissue (n = 4), needle-free injection to the sl/b tissue (n = 5), or intradermally (with mva-hiv) and subcutaneously (with cycp-gp120 + dmlt) (n = 6). mva-hiv and cycp-gp120 doses were split between the buccal and sublingual tissue (sl/b) or the left and right thigh (id/sc). 19 weeks following the second cycp-gp120 immunization, animals were challenged intra-rectally with low dose pathogenic shiv-sf162p3 weekly for up to six weeks. cartoons depict mva-hiv and virus-like particles, cycp-gp120,

immunized female rhesus macaques orally via either topical application to the sl/b tissue (n = 4), needle-free injection to the sl/b tissue (n = 5), or the conventional intradermal and subcutaneous route (id/sc) (n = 6). macaques were immunized twice with 1 × 108 pfu (plaque-forming units) of mva-hiv expressing hiv-1 clade b gag, pol, env (strain ada) followed by two boosts with 100 μg of trimeric clade b cycp-gp120 immunogen (strain jrfl) along with the mucosal adjuvant dmlt (fig. 2c)13,28. doses were split in half between the sublingual and buccal tissue or the left and right thigh of id/sc immunization.mva-hiv is a well-characterized viral vector for hiv-1 vaccines, currently being tested in human clinical trials as a potential vaccine candidate for hiv-1 and expresses trimeric hiv-1 envelope (gp150) on the surface of infected cells and produces virus-like particles (vlps)15,29. cycp-gp120 is a novel trimeric gp120 immunogen, stabilized by a heterologous trimerization domain inserted into the v1-loop of a cyclic permutated gp12018,19. based on previous dose-escalating studies evaluating dmlt as a mucosal adjuvant, needle-free sl/b and topical sl/b cycp-gp120 immunization were adjuvanted with 25 μg of dmlt per site, while subcutaneous cycp-gp120 immunization in the id/sc group was adjuvanted with 1 μg of dmlt. since we observed swelling of mouth following the first cycp-gp120 + dmlt boost, and to make the second boost comparable between needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunization, we reduced the dose of dmlt for the second cycp-gp120 immunization to 1 μg per site30.needle-free vaccination induces strong serum igg responsesimpressively, needle-free sl/b immunization generated a strong anti-ada gp120 igg response in serum, a feature that is not common for oral immunizations (fig. 2d). two mva-hiv immunizations induced low levels of binding antibodies (geo-mean titer, 9.6 μg ml−1) that were boosted remarkably by 100-fold following the 1st protein boost (geo-mean titer, 1012 μg ml−1). these responses contracted by 10-fold over 8 weeks and were marginally boosted upon the 2nd protein boost (geo-mean titer, 258 μg ml−1). at the time of pre-challenge, 14 weeks after the final protein boost, anti-gp120 serum igg titers had contracted about 10-fold (geo-mean titer, 27 μg ml−1). in contrast, topical sl/b immunization resulted in minimal or undetectable antibody responses following both mva-hiv and cycp-gp120 immunizations. remarkably, while gp120-specific igg responses induced by the needle-free sl/b immunization were comparable with id/sc group following mva immunizations, they were 10-fold (geo-mean titer 1012 vs. 120 ug/ml) and 3-fold higher (geo-mean titer, 258 vs 94 μg ml−1) following the 1st and 2nd protein boosts, respectively. however, we are uncertain if this was because of the higher dose of the adjuvant used in the needle-free group during the 1st protein boost. despite differences in the adjuvant doses, these data show that needle-free sl/b injection is an effective non-invasive method of generating high titers of vaccine-specific serum igg. as dmlt is currently being investigated for its potential as a vaccine candidate against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) infection31, we also measured serum igg responses against dmlt and found a strong anti-dmlt igg response generated in needle-free sl/b immunized animals upon boosting with cycp-gp120 adjuvanted with dmlt (fig. 2e). these results demonstrate that needle-free sl/b immunization is an effective route to non-invasively generate strong systemic vaccine-specific igg antibody responses against multiple antigens.needle-free vaccination induces strong mucosal igg and igaas a major goal of mucosal vaccination is the generation of mucosal immune responses, we measured vaccine-specific igg and iga antibodies in the rectal, vaginal, and salivary secretions. due to the variable amounts of immunoglobulin in secretions, antibody concentrations were normalized relative to the total igg or iga concentrations by calculating the specific activity (sa; ng gp120-specific igg or iga per total μg igg or iga)32. as with the systemic responses, needle-free sl/b immunization generated a strong gp120-specific igg response in rectal, vaginal, and salivary secretions (fig. 3a, b, c). similar to serum igg responses, the mucosal igg responses also peaked after the 1st protein boost and the 2nd protein boost showed a small recall (<2-fold). at the peak (wk 25), the igg sa was comparable between the three mucosal compartments (geo-mean of specific activity; rectal, 56; vaginal 43; salivary, 51). topical sl/b immunization generated minimal to undetectable mucosal antibodies, highlighting the importance of the needle-free injector to generate these responses. additionally, while id/sc immunization did result in mucosal igg responses, these were significantly lower than needle-free sl/b responses at the peak time point (wk 25). mucosal igg responses after the first protein boost contracted and were modestly expanded by the subsequent boost before contraction to the pre-challenge time point. interestingly, while the gp120-specific rectal and vaginal igg antibodies were maintained until pre-challenge, igg antibodies in the saliva declined and approached undetectable levels, suggesting the establishment and maintenance of vaccine-specific igg antibody responses varied between mucosal compartments.fig. 3needle-free sl/b immunization generates strong mucosal antibody responses. a–c anti-ada gp120 igg

sl/b immunization also generated vaccine-specific iga antibodies in all three mucosal compartments, with strongest responses in vaginal secretions with all animals generating detectable vaginal iga responses (geo-mean sa of 7.9) and weakest in saliva with only 2 out of 5 animals generating detectable iga (fig. 3d, e, f). the peak rectal and vaginal iga response (wk 25) was significantly higher in needle-free sl/b compared to id/sc immunized animals, which generated minimal mucosal iga responses, and these responses were largely undetectable in topical sl/b immunized animals. rectal iga and salivary iga levels contracted over time and were predominately undetectable at the time of pre-challenge. however, vaginal iga responses were still detectable at the time of pre-challenge, suggesting this route may generate durable vaginal antibody responses. in addition to gp120 specific antibodies, we also measured antibodies against the gp70-v1v2 scaffold antigen, which displays the variable loops 1-2 (v1v2) loops of gp120, as serum igg antibodies directed against gp70-v1v2 were a major correlate of protection in the rv144 trial33,34. both needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunization generated anti-gp70-v1v2 igg in both rectal and vaginal secretions throughout the immunization regimen, however these responses were not long-lasting as they had contracted to undetectable levels by the pre-challenge time point (fig. 3g, h). these results indicate that needle-free sl/b immunization is an easy and practical method of generating strong igg responses in rectal, vaginal and oral mucosa, and strong iga responses in vaginal mucosa.needle-free vaccination induces broad v1v2 and v2hs responseto address the global diversity of hiv-1, an effective vaccine should ideally recognize hiv-1 isolates from multiple strains and clades. to characterize the cross-reactivity of mva/cycp-gp120 induced antibodies, we measured antibody binding to a global panel of gp120, gp140 and gp70-v1v2 scaffold proteins via binding antibody multiplex assay (bama)35. upon boosting with cycp-gp120 we observed a strong cross-reactive antibody response against multiple clades of gp120 and gp140 antigens, reacted to by all immunized animals (fig. 4a). responses were significantly higher in 15/16 of the antigens tested for needle-free orally immunized animals compared to id/sc immunized at this time point (wk 25), however at the pre-challenge time point both groups had similar levels of reactivity (supplementary fig. 2a). these results show the high broadly-reactive antibody response generated by mva/cycp-gp120 regimen, a crucial component to an hiv-1 vaccine candidate.fig. 4serum igg specificity, neutralizing activity, and effector function. binding of igg antibodies at two weeks

infectionfull size imageas results from the rv144 trial suggest that antibodies directed towards the v1v2 loop of gp120 are associated with reduced risk of infection33, the generation of these antibodies, especially broadly reactive v1v2-directed antibodies, is of great interest in hiv-1 vaccine development. to measure the cross-reactivity of v1v2-directed antibodies, sera igg binding to a panel of 16 gp70-v1v2 scaffolds representing the global diversity of hiv-1 was quantified via bama. two weeks post the first protein boost, needle-free sl/b immunized animals generated a substantial broadly cross-reactive gp70-v1v2 response against multiple clades of isolates, significantly higher than id/sc immunization, demonstrating not only the high immunogenicity of the sublingual and buccal route, but also the broadening of the antibody responses upon needle-free oral delivery (fig. 4b). similarly, the anti-env response at the pre-challenge time point responses to gp70-v1v2 scaffolds had contracted in both groups, with no significant differences between the groups, suggesting that through contraction and further boosting in id/sc immunized animals the v1v2 response leveled to a set point (supplementary fig. 2b).to map the regions of gp120 targeted by the vaccine-induced antibody response, we measured binding via peptide microarray of sera to 15-mer peptides (overlapping by 12 amino acids) derived from 13 strains including consensus clade b env (supplementary table 1). both needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunization resulted in a broad response against numerous regions of consensus clade b gp120, the strongest responses directed against the c1, c2, v3, and c5 regions of gp120 (fig. 4c). binding responses against linear v2 hotspot epitope36 was developed against consensus b (fig. 4c) as well as to other clade consensus and viral strains at lower magnitude (supplementary fig. 2c). linear v2 binding was a subdominant response compared to v3 and c4 linear epitope binding, consistent with previous findings for hiv-1 env vaccine-elicited antibody responses37. comparing needle-free sl/b to id/sc peptide responses showed similar trends in both groups, with a high proportion of the igg response directed towards the c1, v3, and c5 regions, however needle-free sl/b immunization resulted in a modestly larger proportions of response against the v2, c4, v5, and c5.1 regions (fig. 4d).we next measured antibody responses to the v2 hotspot (v2-hs) peptide, a region of the v2 loop (spanning positions 166–178 of hiv-1 stain hxb2) in which antibody recognition correlated significantly with decreased risk of infection in the rv144 trial36,38. responses to the consensus b v2 peptides were detected in the peptide microarray analysis, primarily in the needle-free sl/b group, though these responses were modest compared to other regions. to determine responses to the v2-region of the vaccine and challenge virus strains, we synthesized 13 amino-acid peptides corresponding to the v2 hotspot of cycp-gp120 (clade-b jrfl, e168k), mva-hiv (clade-b ada), and shiv-sf162p3 (clade-b)39. needle-free sl/b immunization generated a strong cross-reactive v2 hotspot response, recognizing not only the mva-hiv and cycp-gp120 vaccine strains (ada, jrfl e168k), but also the heterologous shiv-sf162p3 (fig. 4e), similar to previous studies examining antibody responses generated by cycp-gp12019. id/sc immunization resulted in minimal v2 responses compared to needle-free sl/b immunization, which is likely due to the overall antibody response being significantly lower in id/sc immunized animals at this time point. the cross-reactivity of v2 antibody responses to heterologous strains detected in both linear peptide microarray and in v2 hotspot elisa demonstrates the remarkable ability of cycp-gp120 to generate v2-hotspot binding antibodies.the generation of neutralizing antibodies to hiv-1 is a long-sought goal of hiv-1 vaccination. to test the presence of neutralizing antibodies generated by mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 immunization, we measured the neutralizing activity of sera against a multi-clade panel of pseudoviruses that have high (sf162.ls, mw965.26), moderate (bal.26), or low (ada, jr-fl, tro.11) neutralization sensitivity (tier-1a, -1b, -2, respectively). needle-free sl/b immunization induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibodies against the neutralization sensitive clade-b sf162.ls and the moderately resistant clade-b bal.26 isolate after the first and second protein boosts than id/sc immunization (fig. 4f). at the pre-challenge time point, however, both responses were not significantly different. additionally, we detected no tier-2 (neutralization resistant) neutralizing antibody responses, which is in line with our previous results19, suggesting that mutations to cycp-gp120, or additional homologous immunizations18, may be required to generate tier-2 neutralizing activity.the results of the rv144 trial suggest that non-neutralizing antibodies may have a role in protection as vaccine-induced v1v2-directed antibodies were largely non-neutralizing33. furthermore, non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a correlate of protection from hiv, siv, and shiv infection in both human and non-human primate studies40. to evaluate non-neutralizing antibody effector functionality, we characterized antibody-dependent phagocytosis (adp) (fig. 4g), which measures the internalization of gp120-coated by monocytes via the binding of anti-gp120 igg to fc receptors, and antibody-dependent cellular viral inhibition (adcvi) (fig. 4h), which measures the combined ability of monocytes and natural killer (nk) cells (within human pbmcs) to eliminate infected target cells (hiv sf162-infected ccr5+ cem-nkr cells) and released cell-free virus in the presence of env-specific antibodies. in serum, taken at pre-challenge, we measured a range of adp and adcvi activity in both vaccine groups, suggesting a breadth of effector functionality in the antibody response. interestingly, when measuring adcvi activity, we found that sera from some animals enhanced viral outgrowth rather than inhibiting replication, whereas other sera inhibited up to 80% of viral outgrowth compared to controls (effectors + targets + naive serum). adcvi activity was not related to the magnitude of the antibody response at the pre-challenge time point (supplementary fig. 2d), indicating that antibody effector functionality is more dependent on specificity than magnitude, and certain antibody responses may be detrimental in combating hiv-1.needle-free vaccination induces t cell responses in bloodto measure the cellular immune responses after immunization, we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with hiv-1 clade b consensus gag and env peptides and measured cytokine production in t-cells (live cd3+ cells) by flow cytometry (supplementary figure 3a, fig. 5a). immunization with mva-hiv resulted in ifn-γ production in cd4+ t-cells against both gag and env peptides, peaking one week after the second mva-hiv immunization (wk 16), and responses were similar between needle-free sl/b and id/sc groups (fig. 5b). similar to ifn-γ responses, gag and env specific tnf-α (fig. 5c) and il-2 (fig. 5d) producing cd4+ t-cells were also observed, peaking again after the second mva-hiv. interestingly, unlike ifn-γ production, both tnf-α and il-2 responses were expanded upon the first cycp-gp120 + dmlt boost. in contrast to vaccine-specific cd4 t-cell responses, we detected only low levels of vaccine-specific cd8 t-cell responses that peaked after the second mva-hiv immunization and contracted to below detection over the course of the immunization (fig. 5e). however, we did not detect vaccine-specific t-cell responses in the rectal or vaginal tissues after immunization, suggesting that stronger t-cell generating vaccine strategies, such as the utilization of dna-primes, may be necessary to induce these responses41. as a major concern with hiv-1 vaccines is the unwanted generation of an abundance of hiv target cd4+ t-cells in the mucosal tissue, we characterized the phenotypes of cd4 t-cells in rectal tissue at time of pre-challenge and found that needle-free sl/b, topical sl/b, and id/sc immunized animals all had similar levels of activated (hla-dr+ccr5+) cd4+ t-cells in the rectal tissue, indicating that immunization did not result in an accumulation of target cells in the rectal mucosa (supplementary fig. 3b,c). taken together, these data show that needle-free sl/b immunization is capable of generating vaccine-specific functional t-cell responses in the blood, similar to responses generated by conventional id/sc immunization.fig. 5needle-free sl/b immunization generates vaccine-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells in the blood. pmbcs were stimulated with hiv-1 consensus b gag and env peptides and analyzed by flow cytometry for

boost with repeat low dose weekly intrarectal challenges of shiv-sf162p3 for maximum of six exposures39. the envelope in shiv-sf162p3 virus is a tier-2 env, heterologous to the vaccine strains, and we measured no detectable neutralization against this env in vaccinated animals. five unvaccinated female macaques were used as a control group. following challenge, all unvaccinated animals were infected by the third challenge with 3 of the 5 becoming shiv infected after the 1st exposure. impressively, we detected a significant delay in acquisition of infection in both the needle-free sl/b immunized (p = 0.019) and id/sc (p = 0.0074) immunized animals, but not topical sl/b immunization (p = 0.20) (log-rank (mantel-cox) test), with two id/sc immunized animals remaining uninfected after the sixth challenge (fig. 6a). vaccine efficacy per exposure for each group was calculated to be 58% (needle-free sl/b) and 77% (id/sc) (fig. 6b). no differences in vaccine efficacy were observed between these two vaccine groups. tracking viral loads following infection, we detected a trend for lower set-point viral loads in immunized animals, but these did not reach significance (fig. 6c).fig. 6needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunization results in delayed acquisition of shiv-sf162p3 infection. animals were challenged weekly with an intra-rectal low dose (1:100 dilution) of shiv-sf162p3. 5 unvaccinated macaques were used as a control. a acquisition of infection in topical sl/b, needle-free sl/b, or id/sc immunized animals (log-rank (mantel-cox) test). dotted line,

(kendall’s tau correlation test). needle-free sl/b (blue squares) and id/sc (gray triangles) are combined for analysis (n = 11)full size imagedue to the low sample size in the vaccine groups, elucidating clear correlates of protection can be challenging. as both needle-free sl/b and id/sc showed a significant delay in acquisition, as well as receiving the same vaccine immunogens, we combined the two groups for correlation analyses. to identify immune response profiles that could differentiate animals that showed delayed acquisition or were protected (>/=5 challenges) versus no delay in acquisition (<5 challenges), we performed a principal component analysis (pca) with the all immune responses measured in this study. pca results showed that principal component 1 (pc1), containing ten variables, could separate animals with and without delayed acquisition (fig. 6d), while a simulated pca performed with the ten pc1 variables using randomized assay data showed no separation (supplementary fig. 4a). loadings for pc1 included cd4+ env specific t cell responses, pre-challenge adcvi activity, and v2 hotspot binding, as well as lower c5.3 linear epitope binding (supplementary fig. 4b). univariate analysis for these variables confirmed a significant positive correlation between the acquisition of infection and pre-challenge adcvi activity (fig. 6e), env-specific tnf-α+ cd4 t cells (fig. 6f) or env-specific ifn-γ+ tnf-α+ cells (supplementary fig. 5a). in addition, there was a trend for positive correlation between the acquisition of infection and v2 hotspot binding (fig. 6g). in addition, several parameters of the immune response correlated or highly trended with protection from infection, but these were observed only within single groups. these include the peak (wk 25) serum igg response, rectal igg responses at pre-challenge, and the v2 hotspot response against the shiv-sf162p3 challenge virus strain (supplementary fig. 5b). taken together, these data show that mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 induced t-cell and antibody responses contribute to protection against pathogenic shiv-sf162p3 infection.discussion the oral mucosa has been studied extensively as a site of mucosal vaccination in animal models predominately through the topical application and natural uptake of vaccines by the oral mucosa6,42. in this study, we tested the influence of delivering vaccines across the mucosa using a needle-free device on generating a strong mucosal and systemic immunity. our results demonstrated that needle-free injection of the sublingual and buccal tissue is an easy, safe, and efficient method of vaccination for generating strong mucosal and systemic antibody responses. needle-free sl/b immunization also resulted in induction of strong cd4 and cd8 t cell responses in blood that were comparable to systemic immunization. the strong immunogenicity of the sl/b tissue, which is often regarded as a site for immune tolerance induction6,43, suggests the adjuvant activity of mva-hiv and dmlt effectively overcomes the tolerogenic nature of the oral tissue to generate vaccine-specific t and b cell responses. the concept of needle-free delivery of vaccines is not new as recent studies examined needle-free injection through the skin as a method of vaccination in humans10,11,44,45,46. however, to our knowledge this method of vaccination has not been explored for sl/b route in humans or non-human primates and thus our study represents the first demonstration that needle-free sl/b immunization as an attractive approach for mucosal vaccination with protective potential against hiv, warranting further studies to characterize this route for hiv/siv and other mucosal pathogens.an impressive finding of our study is that oral needle-free vaccination induces strong humoral and cellular responses in blood in addition to mucosal compartments. this was in contrast to previous oral topical vaccination studies, which showed relatively poor systemic immunity47,48 highlighting the unique ability of needle-free vaccination to generate systemic immunity. one question that remains to be addressed is how comparable are the systemic immune responses induced by the oral needle-free vaccination to systemic immunization. we are unable to determine this in this study due to the use of higher adjuvant dose during the 1st protein boost. nevertheless, our data show that at least after mva vaccinations they are comparable.the mechanisms by which needle-free sl/b vaccination induces a strong mucosal and systemic immunity need further investigation. in addition, since we vaccinated via both buccal and sublingual routes simultaneously, we cannot conclude if buccal or sublingual vaccination alone is superior compared to each other. to gain insights into the role of different antigen-presenting cells in the mouth, we characterized different subsets of dc in the buccal and sublingual tissue. our results showed the presence of multiple subsets of dcs, including langerhans cells (lcs), cd14+dc-sign+ dermal dcs, and bdca-1+ (cd1c+) conventional dcs (cdcs). these subsets have been shown to have multiple roles in the generation of tolerance or immunity. for example, lcs are generally considered to be tolerogenic and aid in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier, however there is increasing evidence that these cells have some functional plasticity and are capable of becoming immunogenic based on the specific context of inflammation49,50. in contrast, cdcs are thought to be more involved with the induction of immunity and cross-presentation of antigens, and dermal dcs or similar cd14+ cells have been shown to be important in t-follicular helper cell formation and b-cell activation8,20,51. additionally, while these subsets were found in both buccal and sublingual tissue, we found that the buccal tissue had significantly higher proportion of both bdca-1+ cdcs and dermal dcs than the sublingual tissue. the larger proportion of these subsets suggests the buccal tissue may be a preferred target of immunization, although most oral tissue immunization studies have targeted the sublingual tissue6. future studies should evaluate buccal vs sublingual only immunization to compare the differences in these tissues, as well as evaluate the effect different adjuvants have on the activation and function of the different dendritic cell subsets.it is well known that dcs in the gut-associated lns express high levels of raldh enzymes, which are important to convert vitamin a into the gut-homing imprinting retinoic acid. interestingly, we did not detect strong raldh activity in buccal and sublingual dc subsets. however, we did detect this activity in dcs within the oral draining lymph nodes, demonstrating these lymph node-resident dc are capable of imprinting gut-homing characteristics on t- and b-cells23. it is possible that dcs in the buccal and sublingual tissue upregulate raldh activity upon activation by mva as we showed previously for ad5 vaccination in mice25, or traffic vaccine antigens to the lymph node in which resident dcs imprint gut-homing characteristics. further studies elucidating which dcs take up the antigen and present to t and b cells in the sl/b mucosa will help to understand the mechanisms of mucosal priming and further improving the effectiveness of this route in generating vaccine responses.this study also demonstrates for the first-time protective efficacy of mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 vaccination against a heterologous tier-2 neutralization resistant shiv-sf162p3 infection in macaques52. mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 immunization induced broadly cross-reactive gp120, gp140, and gp70-v1v2 serum igg, tier-1a and -1b neutralizing antibodies, gp120-specific antibody-dependent phagocytic (adp) activity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated viral inhibition (adcvi) activity, and vaccine-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses in pbmcs. upon challenging immunized animals intra-rectally with a low dose of heterologous, hard to neutralize, shiv-sf16p3, we observed a delayed acquisition of infection in both needle-free sl/b and id/sc vaccine groups, compared to unvaccinated controls. topical sl/b immunized animals showed no significant protection. the lack of neutralizing antibodies against tier-2 neutralization resistant hiv-1 isolates, including against shiv-sf162p3, indicates non-neutralizing antibody effector functions may be important for protection53. furthermore, while tier-1a or -1b neutralizing antibodies did not correlate with protection, we observed a significant correlation in adcvi activity at pre-challenge in needle-free sl/b and id/sc immunized animals. adcvi activity is a measurement of a combination of anti-viral antibody effector functions, including adp, opsonization, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc), which may synergize in inhibiting viral replication. interestingly, adp activity alone did not correlate with protection (supplementary fig. 5c), suggesting additional anti-viral functions measured by adcvi are required for protection. in addition to adcvi activity, we found a significant correlation with anti-env cd4+ t-cell response after the second cycp-gp120 immunization, as well as a positive trend in anti-v2 antibodies with delayed shiv acquisition, supporting recent studies highlighting the importance of v2-specific antibodies in the human efficacy trials34,38,54 as well as both v2-specific antibodies and t-cell responses in non-human primate studies evaluating poxvirus/gp120 vaccination55,56. these responses show both the cellular and antibody response, despite being non-neutralizing, are crucial for protection from shiv infection.while needle-free sl/b immunization generated a strong mucosal igg and iga vaccine-specific response, these responses contracted significantly at the time of pre-challenge in the rectal secretions, with most animals showing no detectable vaccine-specific rectal iga. in contrast, all immunized animals had detectable anti-gp120 igg in rectal secretions at the pre-challenge time point, and animals showing the greatest level of contraction in the rectal igg response were significantly more likely to be infected (supplementary fig. 5d), highlighting the role of mucosal antibody responses in protection from mucosal pathogens. thus, it is important to test the influence of different adjuvants on the magnitude and longevity of antibody responses induced by needle-free oral vaccination. the potential adjuvants include tlr7/8 agonists, tlr4 agonists and a combination of these. the development of improved vaccine regimens and adjuvants that improve the duration of the antibody response, especially in the mucosal secretions, may aid in long-term protection from infection. additionally, unlike the rectal iga responses, needle-free sl/b immunization resulted in a strong and long lasting hiv-1 specific vaginal iga response, still detectable at the time of pre-challenge. previous studies have demonstrated the importance of hiv-1 specific vaginal iga in protection from vaginal shiv challenge5,57, indicating needle-free sl/b may be superior to id/sc immunization in this context.in conclusion , our study demonstrates the vaccine-mediated protection of mva-hiv/cycp-gp120 immunization against a pathogenic, heterologous shiv, as well as the viability and effectiveness of needle-free sl/b immunization as an alternative to conventional needle-based vaccination. future studies will further evaluate the needle-free sl/b route of vaccination in comparison with conventional routes, including examining the effects of adjuvant dosage on vaccine responses as well as investigating this route in generating protective immune responses against other mucosal pathogens.methodsethics statementall housing and experiments involving rhesus macaques were conducted at the yerkes national primate research center, and protocols were approved by the emory university institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc) protocol yer-2003491. experiments were carried out in accordance to usda regulations and recommendations derived from the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. rhesus macaques were housed in pairs in standard non-human primate cages and provided with both standard primate feed (purina monkey chow) fresh fruit, and enrichment daily, as well free access to water. immunizations, blood draws, and other sample collections were performed under anesthesia with ketamine (5–10 mg kg−1) or telazol (3–5 mg kg−1) performed by trained research and veterinary staff.animals and immunizationindian female rhesus macaques were immunized on weeks 0 and 15 with 1 × 108 pfu of mva-62sm expressing hiv-1 gag, pol, and env (strain ada gp150)58, and boosted with 100 μg of recombinant jrfl-hcmp-v1cyc (cycp-gp120)18 in combination with the mucosal adjuvant double mutated heat-labile enterotoxin (dmlt)13. mva-62sm was grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts. animals were separated into three groups based on the route of immunization. group 1, topical application: immunizations were applied topically by pipette to the buccal and sublingual tissue in 100 μl volume, with the animals remaining in upright position for one minute to allow for natural absorption. dmlt dose was 25 μg per tissue site for each time point. the dose of mva-hiv and cycp-gp120 was split between both tissue sites. group 2, needle-free oral injection: immunizations were delivered via the syrijet mark-ii needless injector (keystone industries) as 100 μl injections to the sublingual and buccal tissues. mva-hiv and cycp-gp120 doses were split between both tissue sites. dmlt dose was 25 μg per tissue site for the first cycp-gp120 boost, and 1 μg per tissue site for the second cycp-gp120 boost. group 3, intradermal and subcutaneous injection: mva-hiv was delivered intradermally and cycp-gp120 was delivered subcutaneously to the right and left thigh, the dose being split between each thigh. both subcutaneous and intradermal injections were delivered at a volume of 100 μl. dmlt dose for each time point was 1 μg per site. recombinant cycp-gp120 was produced by transfection of 293-f cells (thermofisher) with a plasmid encoding secreted jrfl-cycp-gp120, followed by lectin column purification (ge) and buffer-exchange dialysis with pbs18. trimeric cycp-gp120 was confirmed by native-page gel analysis.intrarectal shiv challengerhesus macaques were challenged intra-rectally with hiv-1 clade-b env expressing neutralization resistant shiv-sf162p3 diluted 1:100 in 1 ml sterile rpmi weekly for a maximum of six challenges39. challenge stocks were derived from the expansion of nih aids repository derived shiv-sf162p3 in rhesus pbmcs. following sequencing, stocks were titrated for low dose repeated intra-rectal challenges. plasma samples taken one week post each challenge were analyzed by pcr for detection of viremia (>60 copies/ml). the following primers were used to detect siv gag in plasma, 5′-gcagaggaggaaattacccagtac-3′ and 5′-caattttacccaggcatttaatgtt-3. viral loads were monitored for up to 12 weeks post-infection to determine the peak and set-point viral loads. viral load analysis performed by the yerkes cfar virology core.binding antibody detection assaysrhesus macaque serum igg binding to recombinant ada gp120 (immune technology corp) was measured by elisa. microtiter plates were coated with 0.5 μg ml−1 of ada gp120 in pbs at 4 ˚c overnight followed by 3-fold serial dilutions of rhesus macaque sera before detection with anti-rhesus igg hrp (southern biotech) diluted 1:4000 and the tmb microwell peroxidase substrate kit (kpl). additionally, serum igg binding to dmlt was measured by elisa using microtiter plates coated with 0.5 μg ml−1 dmlt in pbs and detected similarly to anti-gp120 igg. concentrations of gp120 or dmlt-specific igg were quantified using a rhesus igg standard based on microtiter plates coated with 1 μg ml−1 anti-rhesus igg (southern biotech) and standardized using recombinant rhesus igg (southern biotech) serially diluted 3-fold, starting with 100 ng ml−1 14. peptides corresponding to the v2-hotspot region of hiv-1 strains jr-fl-e168k (n-rdkvqkeyalfykld-c), ada (n-rdkvkkdyalfyrld-c), sf162p3 (n-gnkmqkeyalfyrld-c) were synthesized (genemed synthesis inc.), microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg ml−1 of peptide at 4 ˚c overnight, and binding of macaque sera (1:100 dilution) was measured by elisa (od 450 reading). for mucosal antibody responses, rectal, vaginal or salivary secretions were eluted from weck-cel collection sponges32. concentrations of ng-specific igg or iga antibodies to gp120 ada or gp70-v1v2 clade b/case a2 (from dr. abraham pinter, rutgers medical school, nj) were measured by elisa and divided by the concentration of total ug igg or iga to obtain the specific activity59. specific activities were considered significant if they were greater than the mean specific activity plus three standard deviations measured in pre-immunization samples.neutralization assaysneutralizing antibody activity was measured in 96-well culture plates by using tat-regulated luciferase (luc) reporter gene expression to quantify reductions in virus infection in tzm-bl cells. tzm-bl cells were obtained from the nih aids research and reference reagent program, as contributed by john kappes and xiaoyun wu. assays were performed with hiv-1 env-pseudotyped viruses as described60. test samples were diluted over a range of 1:20 to 1:43740 in cell culture medium and pre-incubated with virus (~150,000 relative light unit equivalents) for 1 h at 37 oc before addition of cells. following 48 h incubation, cells were lysed and luc activity determined using a microtiter plate luminometer and britelite plus reagent (perkin elmer). neutralization titers are the sample dilution at which relative luminescence units (rlu) were reduced by 50% compared to rlu in virus control wells after subtraction of background rlu in cell control wells (id50). serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 oc for 1 h prior to assay. positive values were reported as being at least 3x baseline values standardized against the negative control virus, sva-mlv.binding antibody multiplex assay (bama)bama assays were performed as follows33,61. serial dilutions (starting at 1:80, six five-fold dilutions) of rabbit or rhesus macaque sera were reacted against beads conjugated to a panel of gp120 (strains 51802, bori, bjox002, 254008, cne20, tt31p.2792, b.6240, a244), uncleaved trimeric gp140 (strains rhpa4259, ae.01.con_env03, 1086.c, c.ch505tf, wito4160, bf1266, 9004s, sc42261), and gp70-v1v2 scaffold proteins (strains b.casea, 7060101641, cm244.ec1, tv1.21, 001428.2.42, cap210.2.00.e8, c2101.c01, bjox002000.03.2, bf1266_431a, 96zm651.02, rhpa4259.7, ce1086_b2, 62357.14, 700010058, 191084_b7, tt31p.2f10.2792) representing the global panel of hiv-1 envs35. binding of sera to beads was detected using a secondary biotin-conjugated anti-rhesus igg and measured via bio-plex. binding is reported as area under curve (auc) analysis generated from measured mfi’s at different serial dilutions. criteria for positive reactivity was as follows: mfi at 1:80 > 100, mfi at 1:80>ag-specific cutoff (95th percentile of all pre-bleed for study for each antigen), mfi>3-fold that of matched pre-bleed before and after blank bead subtraction.linear epitope mapping peptide microarraysolid phase peptide microarray epitope mapping was performed as follows37. briefly, array slides were prepared by jpt peptide technologies gmbh (germany) by printing a library designed by dr. b. korber, los alamos national laboratory, onto epoxy glass slides (polyan gmbh, germany). the library contains 15-mer peptides overlapping by 12, covering consensus env (gp160) clade a, b, c, d, group m, crf1, and crf2 and vaccine strains (gp120) 1.a244, 1.th023, mn, c.1086, c.tv1, and c.zm651. sera were diluted 1:50 and applied to the peptide array, followed by washing and detection using goat anti-human igg-alexa fluor 647. array slides were scanned at a wavelength of 635 nm with an innoscan 710 al scanner (innopsys, france) using xdr mode. scan images were analyzed using magpix 8.0 software to obtain binding intensity values for all peptides. microarray data were then processing using r package pepstat36 to obtain binding signal for each peptide, which is defined as log2 (intensity of post-immunization sample/intensity of matched baseline sample). binding magnitude to each identified epitope is defined as the highest binding signal by a single peptide within the epitope region.antibody-dependent cellular viral inhibition (adcvi)assays for adcvi activity in rhesus macaque serum were performed using hiv sf162 infected cem-nkr cells and cryopreserved human pbmc derived effector cells62. briefly, on day 1, ccr5+ cem-nkr cells (a gift from dr. jim hoxie, university of pennsylvania) were infected with hiv sf162 at an moi of 0.01. on day 2, cryopreserved pbmc were thawed, washed, and added to wells of v-bottom plates in 100 µl of medium containing 1 × 105 cells. on day 3, 50 µl of 1:25 diluted sterile-filtered serum and 50 µl containing 1 × 104 washed, infected cem-nkr cells were added to each well. a pool of monoclonal antibodies was used as a positive control. on day 7, the cells were washed twice to remove any gag-specific antibodies which may interfere with the assay readout on day 10, the medium was harvested, treated with tritonx-100 detergent, and analyzed for viral content using a gag-p24 capture elisa63. the % inhibition of infection was determined by comparing the p24 concentration in wells that had been incubated with test serum to that in wells incubated with naive control macaque serum.antibody-dependent phagocytosis (adp)phagocytosis by serum antibodies was measured using the thp-1 monocytic cell line (atcc) and fluorescent beads labeled with gp120 shiv162p3 (immune technology). the thp-1 cells were maintained at a low density (<0.5 × 106 ml−1) in rpmi 1640 medium containing hepes, 100 units ml−1 pencillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 0.3 mg ml−1 l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fbs (all gibco). for the adp assay, 20 µl of 1 µm neutravidin-labeled fluorospheres (invitrogen) were washed in 1 ml of sterile 1% bsa in pbs in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube that had been preblocked with bsa overnight at 4˚c. the beads were resuspended in 200 µl of 1% bsa containing 7 µg of biotinylated anti-his tag mouse monoclonal antibody (thermofisher) and mixed at 1100 rpm for 1 h at room temperature. the beads were then washed, resuspended in 200 µl of 1% bsa containing 14 µg of his-tagged gp120 shiv162p3 protein (immune technology), and mixed at 1100 rpm overnight at 4 ˚c. the following day, beads were washed and resuspended in 5.5 ml medium. the beads were added in a 25 µl volume to wells of v-bottom plates containing 25 µl of diluted sterile-filtered test serum, pooled serum from naive control rhesus macaques or a positive control anti-hiv env human monoclonal igg antibody (3bnc117; aids reagent program). serum samples were tested in triplicate at 5-fold dilutions starting with a 1:20 final dilution. after a 30 min incubation at 37˚c and 5% co2, 2 × 104 thp-1 cells in 50 µl were added to each well. the plates were then incubated for 5 h. the assay was terminated by centrifuging the plates at 300× g for 5 min, removing the medium, and resuspending the cells in 200 µl of 1% paraformaldehyde. after storage at 4 ˚c overnight, the cells were analyzed for fluorescence by flow cytometry. to determine the phagocytic score, the % of fluorescent (bead-positive) cells was first multiplied by their median fluorescence intensity. this value was then divided by the value obtained for naive control serum at the same dilution. results are presented for 1:20 serum dilutions, which produced peak results. the 3bnc117 antibody (nih aids reagent program) produced a score of 6.5 at 1 μg ml−1.flow cytometry and t-cell responsespbmcs were stimulated with gag (clade-b consensus) or env (clade-b consensus) peptides (2 µg ml−1 final each) (nih aids reagent program) along with anti-cd28 (bd) and anti-cd49d (bd) co-stimulatory molecules (1 µg ml−1 final each) for two hours before the addition of golgistop (bd) and golgiplug (bd) and incubated for an additional four hours. pbmcs were then surface stained with antibodies against cd3 (bd, sp34-2, cat# 562381, 1:400 dilution), cd4 (bd, sk3, custom, 1:2000 dilution), cd8 (bd, rpa-t8, custom, 1:600 dilution), and live/dead fixable stain (thermofisher), then permeablized with cytofix/cytoperm (bd, cat# 554714) and stained with ifn-γ (bd, b27, cat# 560371, 1:200 dilution), tnf-α (bd, mab11, cat# 561023, 1:200 dilution), and il-2 (bd, mq1-17h12, cat# 560707, 1:200 dilution). rectal biopsy samples were digested with 200 u ml−1 collagenase-iv (worthington) and 0.03% dnase-i (life) for two hours before mechanical disruption with a syringe and needle followed by washing with rpmi supplemented with 10% fbs and stained for phenotypic markers, cd3 (bd, sp34-2, cat# 558124, 1:200), cd4 (bd, sk3, custom, 1:2000 dilution), cd8 (bd, rpa-t8, custom, 1:600 dilution), cd45ra (bd, 5h9, cat# 561216, 1:40 dilution), ccr7 (bd, 150503, cat# 562381, 1:50 dilution), ccr5 (bd, 3a9, cat# 742913, 1:40 dilution), hla-dr (bd, g46-6, custom, 1:500 dilution), and live/dead for flow cytometry analysis.rhesus macaque tissue digestion and flow cytometryuninfected rhesus macaques scheduled for necropsy were euthanized and their buccal tissue, sublingual tissue, and submandibular, submental, and inguinal lymph nodes were collected. paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or characterized via immunohistochemistry with an anti-langerin monoclonal antibody (adcam) and visualized with a light microscope. a single-cell suspension was made by digestion of minced tissue with hbss supplemented with 200 u ml−1 collagenase-iv (worthington) and 0.03% dnase-i (life) for two hours before mechanical disruption with a syringe and needle (gauge 12), passage through a cell strainer, and washed with rpmi + 10% fbs. alternatively, buccal and sublingual tissues were paraffin-embedded and analyzed via h&e stain or immunohistochemistry with an anti-langerin monoclonal antibody (adcam, cat# ab192027). single-cell suspensions were analyzed via flow cytometry with the following anti-human monoclonal antibodies: cd209 (bd, dcn46, cat# 564127), cd1c (biolegend, l161, cat# 331515), cd123 (bd, 7g3, cat# 562391), cd45 (bd, d058-1283, cat# 563861), cd14 (bd, m5e2, cat# 564055), cd16 (bd, 3g8, cat# 563691), cd3 (bd, sp34-2, cat# 561805), cd20 (bd, 2h7, cat# 560631), and live/dead fixable stain (thermofisher). all antibodies used at a dilution of 1:40. characterization of retinoic acid production in macaque cells was performed using the aldefluor kit (stemcell) per the manufacturer's instructions. after incubation with the aldefluor reagent in test and control settings, cells were stained and analyzed via flow cytometry, aldefluor+ cell gating was based on the control samples. %aldefluor+ cells were calculated by subtracting the aldefluor+ cell frequency in the control sample gate from the test sample gate.statistical analysisstatistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism v7.0. additional univariate correlation analysis between number of challenges and individual immune measurements was by kendall’s correlation test performed using r and subsequently confirmed using sas. principal component analysis (pca) was performed in r using the prcomp package. variables for pca were pre-selected by ranking of separation between groups, which is defined as the between-group variance divided by within-group variance for each variable.reporting summaryfurther information on

PD-1 blockade potentiates HIV latency reversal ex vivo in CD4+ T cells from ART-suppressed individuals,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08798-7,Research,18 February 2019,yes,"hiv persists in latently infected cd4+ t cells during antiretroviral therapy (art). immune checkpoint molecules, including pd-1, are preferentially expressed at the surface of persistently infected cells. however, whether pd-1 plays a functional role in hiv latency and reservoir persistence remains unknown. using cd4+ t cells from hiv-infected individuals, we show that the engagement of pd-1 inhibits viral production at the transcriptional level and abrogates t-cell receptor (tcr)-induced hiv reactivation in latently infected cells. conversely, pd-1 blockade with the monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab enhances hiv production in combination with the latency reversing agent bryostatin without increasing t cell activation. our results suggest that the administration of immune checkpoint blockers to hiv-infected individuals on art may facilitate latency disruption.
introduction latently infected cells carrying integrated human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) genomes persist during antiretroviral therapy (art) and represent the main barrier to a cure1,2,3. the establishment of latency may result from direct infection of resting cd4+ t cells4 or from infection of cd4+ t cells transitioning from an activated to a resting state5. latently infected cd4+ t cells are rare both before and after art initiation6,7, suggesting that hiv latency is established only in a small fraction of cd4+ t cells.programmed cell death-1 (pd-1) is an immune checkpoint molecule expressed at high levels on the surface of exhausted hiv-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t cells8,9,10,11,12. its blockade enhances cd4+ t cells and cd8+ t cells functions during simian immunodeficiency virus infection13,14.in addition to its role in t-cell exhaustion, pd-1 and other immune checkpoint molecules such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (lag-3) and t-cell immunoreceptor with ig and itim domains (tigit) are preferentially expressed at surface of persistently infected cd4+ t cells15,16,17. of note, follicular helper t (tfh) cells, which express high levels of pd-1, are major producers of viral particles in untreated hiv infection18 and serve as a preferential reservoir for hiv during art19,20. in addition, pd-1 and lag-3 measured prior to art strongly predict time to return of viraemia upon treatment interruption21. however, whether these molecules play an active role in the establishment and maintenance of hiv latency remains unclear.in an in vitro latency model, pd-1 blockade reduces the frequency of latently infected cd4+ t cells22. because pd-1 induces t-cell quiescence and inhibits t-cell activation23, we hypothesized that the engagement of the pd-1 pathway may directly contribute to the establishment of viral latency by inhibiting viral transcription and production. we demonstrate that the engagement of pd-1 abrogates t-cell receptor (tcr)-induced hiv reactivation in latently infected cells isolated from hiv-infected individuals. conversely, pd-1 blockade with the monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab enhances hiv production induced by the latency reversing agent bryostatin without increasing t-cell activation. these results suggest that the administration of immune checkpoint blockers to hiv-infected individuals on art may facilitate latency reversal in vivo.resultspd-1 marks hiv-infected cells in viremic individualsto determine if pd-1 could play a role in the establishment of hiv latency, we first assessed the distribution of hiv in memory cd4+ t cells expressing high and low levels of pd-1 in hiv-infected individuals not receiving art. we found that memory cd4+ t cells expressing pd-1 were preferentially infected, as demonstrated by the higher frequency of integrated hiv dna in pd-1 expressing central (tcm), transitional (ttm), and effector memory (tem) cells as compared to their pd-1 negative (pd-1−) counterparts (median fold-change: 6.5, 2.3, and 2.2, respectively, supplementary fig. 1a). accordingly, flow cytometry sorted pd-1 positive (pd-1+) cells produced higher levels of viral particles, indicating that pd-1+ cells are major targets for productive hiv infection during untreated disease (supplementary fig. 1b).pd-1 engagement inhibits viral productionto determine the impact of pd-1 engagement on hiv production, we stimulated productively infected cd4+ t cells isolated from untreated hiv-infected individuals in the presence or absence of pd-l1, one of the two ligands for pd-1. tcr stimulation led to a marked increase in the amount of the viral protein p24 measured in the culture supernatant and this induction was dramatically reduced in the presence of pd-l1 (98% inhibition, p < 0.0001, fig. 1a and supplementary fig. 1c). of note, this effect was maintained over time, since the inhibition was still observed after 6 and 9 days of culture (fig. 1b, c and supplementary fig. 1d). importantly, pd-l1 acted directly on productively infected cells and not by decreasing the permissiveness of bystander cells since the inhibition of viral production was also observed in the presence of antiretroviral drugs (arvs) that block new infection events as well as in short-term cultures (69–86% inhibition, supplementary fig. 1e–g). to demonstrate the specificity of this mechanism, we sorted pd-1+ and pd-1− memory cd4+ t cells and observed that pd-l1− mediated inhibition was restricted to pd-1+ cells (p = 0.01), since the ligand did not significantly affect viral production in pd-1− cells (fig. 1d).fig. 1pd-1 engagement inhibits viral production in cd4+ t cells from untreated hiv-infected individuals. a relative viral production measured by p24 release in 3-days culture

filefull size imageto gain further insights into the mechanism by which pd-1 engagement inhibited hiv production, we transfected primary cd4+ t cells with an ltr-luciferase reporter construct. the engagement of pd-1 by pd-l1 resulted in a significant reduction in the ltr activity, indicating that pd-1 exerted its inhibitory effect on hiv production at the transcriptional level (p = 0.002, fig. 1e).pd-1 inhibits viral reactivation in latently infected cellshaving demonstrated that the engagement of pd-1 at the surface of productively infected cells inhibited the viral production induced by tcr stimulation, we next sought to determine if this phenomenon could abrogate viral reactivation from latently infected cells. even after years of art, pd-1 expression at the surface of cd4+ t cells from virally suppressed individuals was not normalized (supplementary fig. 2a), notably in the ttm and tem subsets (supplementary fig. 2b–e). similarly, both pd-1 ligands (pd-l1 and pd-l2) were expressed at higher levels at the surface of cd4+ t cells and monocytes from fully suppressed individuals when compared to uninfected controls (supplementary fig. 2f–i). of note, higher frequencies of cd4+ t cells expressing pd-1 were detected in the rectum, colon, and terminal ileum of individuals on art when compared to matched blood and lymph nodes (supplementary fig. 2j). these higher frequencies of cd4+ t cells expressing pd-1 was consistent with heightened frequencies of differentiated memory cd4+ t cells (ttm and tem) in the gut compartment (supplementary fig. 2k). we further confirmed our and others previous observations16,19,24 indicating a strong positive correlation between the frequency of persistently infected cd4+ t cells (as measured by integrated hiv dna) and pd-1 expression in cd4+ t cells during art (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001, supplementary fig. 3a) as well as the preferential infection of pd-1+ tcm and ttm cells during art by measuring integrated hiv dna (median fold-enrichment: 1.7, p = 0.01 and 1.6, p = 0.04, respectively, supplementary fig. 3b). in addition, using the tat/rev induced limiting dilution assay (tilda) and quantitative viral outgrowth assay, we observed that inducible and replication-competent proviruses were enriched in cd4+ t cells expressing pd-1 in the majority of the samples tested (supplementary fig. 3c, d).to assess the effect of pd-1 engagement on viral reactivation from latency, we stimulated cd4+ t cells from virally suppressed individuals in the presence or absence of pd-l1. tcr stimulation led to readily detectable levels of viral production that were dramatically reduced in the presence of pd-l1 (89% inhibition, p < 0.0001, fig. 2a), demonstrating that pd-1 engagement inhibits tcr-induced reactivation in latently infected cd4+ t cells. this inhibition was observed at the transcriptional level and restricted to pd-1+ cells (supplementary fig. 4a, b). similarly, pd-1 engagement inhibited tcr-induced activation of the positive transcription elongation factor b (p-tefb), a master regulator of hiv transcription (82% inhibition of cdk9 phosphorylation, p = 0.01, fig. 2b and 61% inhibition of cyclin t1 expression, p = 0.02, fig. 2c)25.fig. 2pd-1 engagement inhibits viral reactivation from latently infected cells and its blockade enhances viral production ex vivo. a relative viral production measured

ki67, cd25, and hla-dr/cd38 expressions and cell viability measured by flow cytometry after 6 days of culture as described in fig. 2d. source data are provided as a source data filefull size imagepd-1 blockade enhances viral production ex vivosince our results indicated that pd-1 engagement prevents hiv reactivation from latency, we sought to determine if pd-1 blockade could facilitate latency reversal. we stimulated large numbers of cd8- and cd56-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from hiv-infected individuals on suppressive art with the latency reversing agent bryostatin in the presence of a pd-1 blocking antibody (pembrolizumab) or the corresponding isotype control. hiv production was greatly increased by pd-1 blockade (median fold-increase over isotype control (interquartile range (iqr)) 36.00 (7.90–47.25), fig. 2d) without enhancing t-cell activation nor affecting cell viability (fig. 2e). of note, blocking pd-1 also enhanced viral production when latently infected cd4+ t cells were stimulated with suboptimal concentrations of the superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxins a and b (sea and seb) (median fold-increase over isotype control (iqr) 4.23 (2.04–71.96), supplementary fig. 5a). interestingly, pd-1 blockade significantly increased the levels of cytokine production (supplementary fig. 5b, c) but had minimal effects on markers of t-cell homeostasis, proliferation, survival and activation upon tcr or il-7 stimulations (supplementary fig. 6a–g). together, these experiments indicated that blocking pd-1 increases viral production from latently infected cells in response to the latency reversing agent bryostatin and to suboptimal tcr stimulation without enhancing t-cell activation.our in vitro findings were further supported by the progressive decrease in total and integrated hiv dna as well as in cell-associated hiv rna (4-, 3-, and 19-fold decreases, respectively) observed in a virally suppressed individual who received pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma (supplementary fig. 7). we acknowledge that this case report does not prove latency reversal in vivo since a reduction in hiv persistence markers could result from multiple mechanisms, including immune-mediated effects. nonetheless, this observation supports the concept that pd-1 blockade can reduce the latent reservoir in vivo.discussion latently infected cells represent the major obstacle to a cure for hiv infection26. memory cd4+ t cells are constantly exposed to homeostatic signals required for their maintenance (il-7, il-15, and perhaps interactions with self-peptide mhcii complex). however, the long half-life of memory cd4+ t cells and the modest activity of the majority of latency reversing agents27 suggest that inhibitory mechanisms may continuously abrogate viral reactivation in latently infected cells. our results indicate that hiv preferentially persists in pd-1+ cells and that the engagement of pd-1 potently inhibits viral reactivation. it was recently reported that pd-1 suppresses t-cell function primarily by inactivating cd28 signaling28,29, which provides a potential explanation for the preferential persistence of hiv in pd-1+ tcm and ttm cells, two subsets that express high levels of cd28.the ability of tcr signaling to enhance hiv transcription has been associated to release of p-tefb from an inactive complex through an erk-dependent pathway30. in this study, we provide mechanistic evidence that pd-1 engagement inhibits the p-tefb signaling pathway, which likely contributes to the inhibition of hiv production. in addition to its immediate effect on hiv production, pd-1 engagement may also lead to a prolonged silencing of the hiv promoter through metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of t cell31,32,33.importantly, our observations demonstrate that hiv reactivation is enhanced by pd-1 blockade in cd4+ t cells from virally suppressed individuals ex vivo. of note, we observed that pd-1 blockade potentiates latency reversal without inducing global t-cell activation, in spite of increased levels of tcr-induced cytokine production. these observations suggest that cytokine secretion and hiv reactivation can be uncoupled from the induction of t-cell activation. this is in line with studies reporting that reduced levels of il-2 production is sensitive hallmark of pd-1 engagement. since nf-κb is an important factor positively regulating both il-2 and hiv transcription, it is possible that activation of this transcription factor is involved in the increased levels of viral production following pd-1 blockade. as such, increased il-2 secretion following pd-1 blockade was also reported in vivo34. since the level of pd-1 expression on distinct cd4+ t-cell subsets impacts the effect of pd-1/pd-l1 blockade11, it remains to be determined if hiv latency can be reverted in all cellular hiv reservoirs using this strategy. of note, since additional co-inhibitory receptors have been associated with hiv persistence in different subsets16,17,35 combination of immune-checkpoint blockers may be necessary to achieve optimal latency reversal.we observed a progressive decline of several markers of hiv persistence throughout treatment with pembrolizumab in an individual receiving this antibody for malignant melanoma. this case illustrates the ability of pd-1 blockade to reduce the size of the hiv reservoir in some individuals, which is consistent with other studies demonstrating an effect of pd-1 or ctla-4 blockade on hiv reservoir dynamics22,36,37. since this effect is not observed in all virally suppressed individuals38, results from larger ongoing studies enrolling hiv-infected participants receiving immunotherapy for the treatment of malignancies are warranted.the potential toxicity of these immunotherapies and the risk benefit ratio for hiv-infected individuals on stable suppressive art should be considered carefully. to our knowledge, safety data in hiv-infected noncancer patients are not yet available. however, several reports in individuals with hiv and cancer38,39,40 indicate that the frequency of immune related adverse events due to pd-1 blockade in the setting of hiv appears to be similar to non-hiv. of note, in all these studies including ours, the impact of pd-1 blockade on the hiv reservoir was assessed in peripheral blood. knowing that cd4+ t cells expressing pd-1 are found at high frequencies in preferential anatomical hiv reservoirs such as gut, lymph nodes and adipose tissue during art19,41,42, assessing latency reversal and hiv reservoir dynamics after pd-1 blockade administration would require analyzing tissues in which this process is more likely to occur and collecting samples shortly after administration of the pd-1 blocking antibody.to conclude, our findings suggest that pd-1 may provide latently infected cells with a selective advantage to persist during art by continuously inhibiting viral reactivation and provide the rationale for evaluating immune checkpoint blockers in curative strategies.methodsstudy populationhiv-seropositive individuals on stable suppressive art, chronically infected individuals with no history of art and uninfected controls enrolled in this study. all participants signed inform consent approved by the martin memorial health systems (fl, usa), the ucsf (ca, usa), the royal victoria hospital and the chum hospital (qc, canada) review boards (irb #10-1320, ref # 068192 and fwa #00004139, respectively). the participant with metastatic malignant melanoma who received pembrolizumab-based immunotherapy was virally suppressed for more than 3 years and signed inform consent. blood was collected 8 days after the second administration of the antibody and 20 to 40 days after all subsequent treatment cycles over a period of 4 months. we complied with all relevant ethical regulations for work with human participants.immunophenotypingpbmcs were isolated from peripheral blood and leukapheresis using ficoll–paque density gradient centrifugation. single-cell suspensions from lymph node, rectum, colon, and ileal biopsies were prepared as previously described41,43. cryopreserved pbmcs were thawed, washed and stained for phenotyping or cell sorting. to measure the expression of pd-1 in subsets of memory cd4+ t cells, the following antibody panel was used: cd3-alexa700 (clone ucht1, bd#557943), cd4-qdot605 (clone s3.5, invitrogen#q10008), cd8-pb (clone rpa-t8, bd#558207), cd14-v500 (clone m5e2, bd#561391), cd19-amcyan (clone sj25c1, bd#339190), live/dead aqua marker (invitrogen#l34957), cd45ra-apc-h7 (clone hi100, bd#560674), cd27-bv650 (clone o323, biolegend#302828), and ccr7-pe-cy7 (clone 3d12, bd#557648) and pd-1-apc (clone mih4, ebioscience#17-9969-42). gates were defined using fluorescence minus one controls. cd4+ t-cell subsets were identified by cd27, cd45ra, and ccr7 expression on cd4+ t cells after exclusion of dump positive cells (live/dead, cd14 and cd19). pd-1 was measured in gated cd4+ t-cell subsets including naïve cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd8-cd4+ cd45ra+ ccr7+ cd27+), central memory cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd8− cd4+ cd45ra− ccr7+ cd27+), transitional memory cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd8− cd4+ cd45ra− ccr7− cd27+), effector memory cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd8-cd4+ cd45ra− ccr7− cd27−) and terminally differentiated cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd8-cd4+ cd45ra+ ccr7− cd27−). to measure the expression of pd-1 ligands (pd-l1 and pd-l2) the following antibody panel was used: cd3-pb (clone ucht1, bd#558117), cd4-alexa700 (clonerpa-t4, bd#557922), cd8-percpcy5.5 (clone rpa-t8, bd#560662), cd14-fitc (clone m5e2, bd#555397), live/dead aqua marker (invitrogen#l34957), cd45ra-apc-h7 (clone hi100, bd#560674), pd-1-apc (clone mih4, ebioscience#17-9969-42), pd-l1-pe-cy7 (clone mih1, bd#558017), and pd-l2-pe (clone mih18, bd#558066). data were acquired on a bd lsr ii flow cytometer using the facsdiva software (becton dickinson) and analyzed using flow jo version 9 (treestar).cell sortingcentral, transitional and effector memory cd4+ t cells were sorted based on their expression of pd-1. the antibodies used for sorting were similar than those used for phenotyping (supplementary fig. 8). in a second set of experiments, total memory cd4+ t cells (cd3+ cd4+ cd45ra−) were sorted based on their expression of pd-1. sorted cells were collected using a facsaria ii cell sorter (becton dickinson).isolation of total cd4+ t cellstotal cd4+ t cells were isolated from cryopreserved pbmcs using magnetic negative selection as per the manufacturer’s protocol (stem cell technologies, vancouver, canada).quantification of integrated hiv dnatotal cd4+ t cells or sorted cd4+ t-cell subsets were used to measure the frequency of cells harboring integrated hiv dna by real time nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr)44. briefly, cells were lysed by proteinase k digestion. cell lysates were directly used for hiv dna quantifications. integrated hiv-1 dna was amplified with two alu primers together with a primer annealing the ltr/gag region (supplementary table 1). in all pcr reactions, primers specific for the cd3 gene were added to precisely quantify the cell input. in a second round of pcr, appropriate primers and probes were used to amplify hiv sequences from the first round of amplification. inner primers specific for the cd3 gene were used in a separate reaction to determine cell input. the number of copies of integrated hiv-1 dna was calculated by using serial dilutions lysed ach-2 cells as a standard curve. results were expressed as numbers of hiv copies per million cells.quantification of tat/rev inducible multiply spliced hiv rnathe frequency of cd4+ t cells with inducible multiply spliced hiv rna was determined using the tilda6. briefly, cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (pma; 100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 µg/ml) for 12 h. serial dilutions of the stimulated cells (18,000; 9000; 3000, and 1000 cells; 24 replicates per dilution) were distributed in a 96 well plate containing real time pcr (rt-pcr) buffer. multiply spliced hiv rna was quantified by semi nested real time pcr using primers specific for the tat/rev region (supplementary table 1). the frequency of positive cells was calculated using the maximum likelihood method and this number was then expressed as a frequency of cells with inducible mshiv rna per million cells.quantification of cell-associated and cell-free hiv rnacell-associated rna were extracted using the rneasy kit (qiagen). alternatively, freshly collected cell culture supernatants were ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 25,000g to pellet hiv particles. by using this procedure, only packed viral rnas were quantified, excluding hiv rnas that are passively released in the medium as a consequence of cell death. viral rnas were extracted using the qiamp viral rna kit (qiagen) and quantified using an ultrasensitive semi-nested real time rt-pcr with a detection limit of a single copy of hiv rna per reaction45.quantification of viral production by p24 elisaviral production was measured by quantification of the p24 antigen by a sensitive in-house p24 elisa46. in this enzymatic assay, 183-h12-5c (coating) and 31-90-25 (conjugated to biotin) antibodies were used in combination to quantify p24 levels.quantification of replication-competent virussorted memory pd1+ and pd1− cd4+ t cells were activated for 3 days with coated anti-cd3 (clone okt3) and soluble anti-cd28 (clone cd28.2) in presence of anti-pd-1 antibody (pembrolizumab 10 µg/ml) in limiting dilution (from 1.5 million cells to 0.05 million cells). after 3 days of stimulation, cells were washed 2 times with rpmi and co-cultured for an additional 12 days with pha/il-2 activated cd4+ t cells from two hiv negative donors at a ratio 1:3 in medium containing il-2 (5 ng/ml) and anti-pd-1 antibody (pembrolizumab 10 µg/ml, merck). culture were split twice weekly; half of cell culture supernatants were collected for quantification of the viral production by p24 elisa. infectious unit per million cells was determined based on the number of wells positive for p24 using the maximum likelihood method (http://silicianolab.johnhopkins.edu/).pd-1 engagementcd4+ t cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin in the presence or absence of arvs [100 nm efavirenz (efv), 180 nm zidovudine (azt), and 200 nm raltegravir (ral)]. cells were stimulated with cellection pan mouse igg (invitrogen) coated with anti-cd3 (ucht1), anti-cd28 (cd28.2), and pd-l1 chimeric protein (kindly provided by g.j. freeman) or the appropriate isotype control (igg2a). beads were added to cd4+ t cells in a 1:2 (cell:bead) ratio and kept in culture for the entire duration of the experiment (up to 9 days).pd-1 blockadefifteen to 25 × 106 cd8-depleted pbmcs or cd56- and cd8-depleted pbmcs from virally suppressed individuals were stimulated with sea/seb (0.3 ng/ml), il-7 (10 ng/ml), or bryostatin (10 nm, 18 h exposure) in the presence or absence of anti-pd-1 (pembrolizumab 10 µg/ml) or the appropriate isotype control, in the presence of arvs. viral production was measured in cell culture supernatants after 3 or 6 days of culture as described above. samples with spontaneous viral production (>10 hiv rna copies in the nonstimulated condition) and/or inconsistent replicate values attributed to low frequency of reservoir cells were excluded. cytokine production was measured by electrochemiluminescence using multi-array technology (meso scale discovery). bcl-2, cd69, ki67, cd25, and hla-dr/cd38 expressions, phosphorylation of stat5 and akt and cell viability were measured by flow cytometry using the following antibodies: bcl-2-v450 (clone bcl-2/100, bd#560637), cd69-apc (clone fn50, bd#555533), cd25-buv737 (clone 2a3, bd#564385), hla-dr-buv395 (clone g46-6, bd#564040), cd38-pe (clone hit2, bd#555460), pstat5-af647 (py694, bd#612599), and pakt-pe-cf594 (ps473, bd#562465). pd-1 receptor occupancy by the blocking antibody was measured in all experiments by flow cytometry and was constantly higher than 90%.p-tefb activityphosphorylation of cdk9 (ser175) (provided by merck) and level of expression of cyclint1 were measured by flow cytometry after 12 h stimulation of cd4+ t cells isolated from virally suppressed individuals upon pd-1 engagement25. briefly, titrated antibodies (cd3-fitc, cd4-af700, cd8-pb, cd45ra-apc-h7, pd-1-buv737) were added to 2 million cells in 50 μl of pbs in the presence of live/dead dye for 30 min at 4 °c. cells were fixed with formaldehyde 4% (methanol free) for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with perm/wash buffer (bd#554723) for 30 min at 4 °c. intracellular stainings for pcdk9 (pcdk9-af647) and cyclint1 (cyclint1-tritc, santacruz#8127) were conducted in perm/wash buffer for 20 min at room temperature.ltr-luciferasememory cd4+ t cells were isolated by negative magnetic selection (stemcell) from fresh pbmcs obtained from hiv-negative individuals. after 24 h of tcr stimulation (0.1 µg/ml coated anti-cd3 and 1 µg/ml soluble anti-cd28), cells were nucleofected with pblue3′ltr-lucb (nih aids reagent program) using amaxa technology (lonza). twenty-four hour postnucleofection, cells were stimulated with cd3/cd28 ± pd-l1 beads, as described above. luciferase activity was measured after 6 h of stimulation.statistical analysiswe performed pearson’s

Peptide Assembly on the Membrane Determines the HIV-1 Inhibitory Activity of Dual-Targeting Fusion Inhibitor Peptides,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40125-4,Research,1 March 2019,yes,"novel strategies in the design of hiv-1 fusion/entry inhibitors are based on the construction of dual-targeting fusion proteins and peptides with synergistic antiviral effects. in this work we describe the design of dual-targeting peptides composed of peptide domains of e2 and e1 envelope proteins from human pegivirus with the aim of targeting both the loop region and the fusion peptide domains of hiv-1 gp41. in a previous work, we described the inhibitory role of a highly conserved fragment of the e1 protein (domain 139–156) which interacts with the hiv-1 fusion peptide at the membrane level. here, two different dual-targeting peptides, where this e1 peptide is located on the n- or the c-terminus respectively, have been chemically synthesized and their antiviral activities have been evaluated with hiv pseudotyped viruses from different clades. the study of the functional behaviour of peptides in a membranous environment attending to the peptide recognition of the target sites on gp41, the peptide conformation as well as the peptide affinity to the membrane, demonstrate that antiviral activity of the dual-targeting peptides is directly related to the peptide affinity and its subsequent assembly into the model membrane. the overall results point out to the necessity that fusion inhibitor peptides that specifically interfere with the n-terminal region of gp41 are embedded within the membrane in order to properly interact with their viral target.
introduction similarly as innovations in hiv-1 immunotherapy are focused on the design and engineering of bispecific antibodies with two antigen-binding variable fragments of immunoglobulins that recognize two separate antigens, (reviewed by ferrari et al.1), novel strategies in the design of hiv-1 fusion/entry inhibitors are based on the construction of dual-targeting fusion proteins and peptides with synergistic antiviral effects (reviewed by castro et al.2). examples of recombinant protein chimeras have been recently reported. thus, recombinant protein chimeras produced by fusing lectins to peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region of gp41 have been designed to target simultaneously gp120 and gp41 domains causing lytic inactivation of hiv-13,4. moreover, in order to design hiv-1 fusion inhibitors with targeting properties to the precise site of hiv-1 entry, the c34 peptide has been conjugated to anchoring molecules over-expressed on the cell surface such as co-receptors ccr5 or cxcr4. these recombinant protein chimeras have been expressed on the surface of t cell lines and primary cd4+ t cells, conferring particularly potent, broad and durable protection from hiv-1 infection to primary cd4+ t cells in vitro and in humanized mice5. in addition to recombinant proteins, dual-targeting peptide hiv-1 fusion inhibitors have also been described with the ability of binding simultaneously and cooperatively to different gp41 domains6,7,8. the rationale for the design of chimeric peptide fusion inhibitors is based on the sequential nature of the hiv-1 virus-cell fusion process characterized by the appearance of multiple targets that are susceptible to inhibition. thus, the combination of two different peptide fusion inhibitors in the same molecule theoretically implies a synergistic fusion inhibitory activity as well as a greater probability of avoiding the appearance of resistant virus.gb virus type c (gbv-c), recently renamed as human pegivirus (hpgv)9, can be considered as a symbiont or commensal of humans since infections provide a beneficial effect on survival in hiv-1 positive subjects10. previous work of our group demonstrated the antiviral properties of chimeric molecules composed of an e2 region from gbv-c that targets the gp41 loop region and the peptide sequence of vir576 that interacts with the gp41 fusion peptide (fp), both described as hiv-1 inhibitors7. following the same approach, in this work the e2 sequence has been combined with an 18-mer domain from the e1 protein that interacts with the gp41 fusion peptide at the membrane level and has a broad spectrum activity against hiv-1, as we previously reported11. trying to improve this anti-hiv-1 activity, two dual targeting peptides (dt-peptides), where the e1 peptide is on the n- or the c-terminus respectively, have been synthesized. the antiviral activities of the dt-peptides have been evaluated with hiv pseudotyped viruses from different clades.since hiv-1 gp41 glycoprotein is confined between the cellular and the viral membranes, the study of the physicochemical processes involved at this interface is essential to understand the mode of action of fusion inhibitor peptides12,13,14. as it has been previously reported, the interaction of fusion inhibitor peptides with biological membranes may be related to their inhibition efficiency15,16,17. based on this background, in this work conformational and biophysical assays using model membranes have been carried out in order to understand better the requirements of dt-peptides for maintaining their functional behaviour as hiv-1 fusion inhibitors.results and discussion dt-peptides composed of two different sequences from e1 and e2 glycoproteins of the non-pathogenic hpgv have been synthesized with the purpose of targeting two different regions of hiv-1 gp41: the loop and the fusion peptide (fp) (fig. 1).figure 1schematic representation of the corresponding target sites on hiv-1 gp41 glycoprotein of the selected peptide inhibitors: hpgv (45–64) e2 peptide and hpgv (139–156) e1 peptide. primary sequences of the dt-peptides, dt-p1 and dt-p2, are depicted at the bottom of the figure.full size imageto this aim, we have selected the peptide sequence comprising the (45–64) region from the n-terminal part of the e2 protein that has been described as a fusion inhibitor of the late hiv-1 entry steps via interaction with the disulphide loop region of hiv-1 gp4118. in addition, we have also selected the (139–156) region of the e1 protein since recent structural studies carried out by our group have demonstrated the interaction of this peptide sequence with the hiv-1 fp at the membrane level interfering with the stabilization of the six-helix bundle formation in a membranous environment19. penetration of both e1 and e2 peptides in vaginal mucosa through their release from polymeric nanoparticles has been recently studied as a preliminary biopharmaceutical evaluation of their potential microbicidal usefulness20,21. based on these two peptide sequences from the hpgv, described as fusion inhibitors, two different dt-peptides have been synthesized combining the sequences in different orientation through a gly/ser linker. dual-targeting peptide 1 (dt-p1) contains the e1 sequence on c-terminus whereas dual-targeting peptide 2 (dt-p2) contains the e1 sequence on n-terminus of the chimeric peptide. the primary structure of dt-peptides is detailed in fig. 1.the anti-hiv activities of dt-peptides and e1 were comparatively tested against a set of viral pseudotypes carrying hiv envelopes from hiv subtype a, b, c and a/e (table 1) in the tzm-bl reporter cell line. table 2 shows the effective concentration 50 (ec50) values of e1, dt-p1 and dt-p2 peptides.table 1 plasmids used to produce the hiv pseudotypes that express the described envelope protein. pseudotypes were produced by plasmid co-transfections in 293t cells as described by martínez et al.39.full size tabletable 2 ec50 values (in µm) of the peptides against a panel of hiv pseudotypes carrying different envelopes.full size tableboth dt-peptides demonstrated similar antiviral activities against all pseudotypes in the low micromolar range although they were between 2 and 10 times less active than the single e1 peptide. neither of the peptides showed cell toxicity at the tested concentrations. to get further on the functional behavior of dt-peptides responsible for the lower activity, conformational and biophysical studies have been carried out. three different issues on the peptides have been taken into account that might be directly related to the antiviral activity: the peptide recognition of the target sites on gp41, the peptide conformation adopted in a membranous environment and the peptide affinity to the membrane.dt-p2 maintains better recognition of both gp41 target sites than dt-p1the capability of preserving the recognition of target sites on gp41 by both dt-p1 and dt-p2 was first studied. as previously reported7,18, to specifically study the target site of the e2 peptide for dt-peptides we have used a competitive immunoassay using the specific gp41-targeting mab (f240) that recognize the disulfide loop region on gp41 glycoprotein. as it is shown in fig. 2a, both dt-peptides didn’t inhibit similarly the specific recognition of the truncated recombinant gp41mn by the mab f240. although, dt-p2 was able to compete with the mab f240 in the recognition of the disulfide loop region in a dose-dependent manner, the inhibition of mab binding to the gp41 by dt-p1 was significantly lower than that reported for the single e2 peptide. thus, dt-p2 maintains, at the highest concentration, the recognition of the target of the original e2 peptide, whereas dt-p1 decreases its interaction capability with the disulfide loop region on gp41.figure 2comparative study of interaction of the dt-peptides with the hiv-1 gp41 target domains: gp41 loop and fp. (a) inhibition of the mab (f240) binding to immobilized gp41mn induced by dt-peptides and e2 peptide in a competitive assay. (b) inhibitory effect of dt-p1, dt-p2 and e1 peptides on haemolysis induced by the hiv-1 fp. y axis represents the percentage of haemolysis expressed relative to the total haemolysis caused by the respective hiv-1 fp alone.full size imagethe target site of the e1 peptide fusion inhibitor, which is the hiv-1 fp (avgigalflgflgaagstmgars), has also been studied for the dt-peptides. we have tested the recognition of both dt-peptides with the hiv-1 fp by means of the haemolysis assay. although both dt-peptides were able to inhibit haemolysis induced by the fp to some extent at the highest concentrations (fig. 2b), the inhibition pattern of dt-p2 was more similar to that previously reported for the e1 peptide fusion inhibitor11. the highest concentration tested of dt-p2 (5 µm) inhibited 70% whereas dt-p1 only inhibited 25% of haemolysis induced by fp.to deep delve in the recognition of the fp as a target site by the dt-peptides, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) assay was performed22. to this end, both dt-peptides were labeled on solid phase with 5(6)-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (tamra) at the n-terminus. the hiv-1 fp labeled with 6-(7-nitrobenzofurazan-4-ylamino) hexanoic acid (nbd) was used as a donor peptide. the fluorescence assay was assessed in a membranous environment using popg liposomes as model membrane. as depicted in fig. 3b, increased concentrations of tamra-dt-p2 resulted in a decrease of the maximal emission wavelength (λem = 544 nm) of nbd upon excitation at λex = 467 nm, as well as an increase in the maximal emission of rhodamine (580 nm). these results demonstrated that there is an energy transfer from the donor-peptide to the acceptor-peptide due to the association between the hiv-1 fp and the dt-p2.figure 3fluorescence spectra of donor nbd-fp (0.5 µm) (black solid line) and acceptor labelled peptide mixtures in liposomes (100 um) at concentrations ranging from 0.15 µm (grey solid line) to 1.5 µm (black dotted line). acceptor labeled peptides: (a) tamra-dt-p1 in popg liposomes; (b) tamra-dt-p2 in popg liposomes; (c) tamra-dt-p1 in popc liposomes; (d) tamra-dt-p2 in popc liposomes.full size imagethis energy transfer was considerably smaller when the fret assay was carried out in popc liposomes (fig. 3d). as reported, hiv-1 fp shows an α-helical conformation in popg vesicles at a 1:200 peptide:lipid ratio while adopts an extended structure in popc membranes23. hiv-1 fp inserts deeply as an α-helix into the hydrophobic core of popg membrane bilayer and lies on the surface of the lipid bilayer as extended conformation in popc liposomes24. this different conformational behavior of hiv-1 fp depending on the membrane lipid composition, among other factors such as peptide to lipid molar ratio and concentration of divalent cations, has been related to its physiological activity25. thus, the overall results of the fret assays pointed out that the association between dt-p2 and fp is closer when the fp is embedded in the membrane in an α-helix conformation.on the other hand, the fluorescence assay showed that the energy transfer between the nbd-fp and the tamra-dt-p1 was significantly lower in both popg (fig. 3a) and popc (fig. 3c) liposomes. accordingly to the results of the haemolysis assay, the interaction of dt-p1 with the hiv-1 fp is minor and consequently, the dt-p1 is less able to maintain the target site of the original e1 peptide sequence.taking together the fret results for dt-peptides and comparing their fret efficiencies with the ones previously reported for the e1 peptide11, the association between fp and e1 peptide is significantly closer than that between fp and dt-p2. the energy transfer efficiency between fp and e1 peptide at a donor:acceptor 1:1 ratio, was around 30% while the energy transfer efficiency between fp and dt-p2 was only 5%.the overall described biophysical assays demonstrated that dt-p2 maintains better the recognition of both gp41 target sites than dt-p1 but not as efficiently as the single e1 peptide. these results might explain the lower antiviral activity of dt-p1 and to some extent the loss of activity of dt-p2. to understand the lower efficiency of dt peptides in the recognition of the gp41 target sites and consequently their different functional behavior, conformational studies of the peptides on the membrane environment have been next carried out.dt-p2 resembles better the conformation of the e1 peptide in micellespreviously reported computer-based structural analysis of the n-terminal part of the e2 protein demonstrated that the region that comprises the e2 peptide does not contain significant amounts of regular secondary structure and is rather flexible to interact with the disulfide loop of gp41 during hiv-1 entry18. by contrast, structure-activity studies carried out previously by our group have confirmed the importance of some structural elements in the anti-hiv-1 activity of the shorter inhibitor e1 peptide19. as previously determined in our group using nmr spectroscopy, e1 peptide is embedded and adopts a helix-turn-helix secondary structure in presence of dpc-d38 micelles. we decided to evaluate if the modification of e1 peptide in n- and c-terminal ends with e2-gggs/gggs-e2 sequences could affect the e1 main secondary structure. to assess qualitatively the structural changes, i-tasser server to predict secondary structure, conformational analysis by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (atr-ftir) in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (pc) vesicles and evaluation of 1d 1h nmr spectra of the dt-peptides in zwitterionic micelles were used26. first, the secondary structure prediction showed that in both peptides, the e1 moiety conserves the helix-coil-helix secondary structure (supplementary fig. s5). second, in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (pc) the atr-ftir second derivative spectra indicated that both peptides show a characteristic α-helix peak position at 1650 cm−1 (fig. 4).figure 4absorbance second derivative of atr-ftir spectra for the c = o stretch and amide i regions for liposomes in the absence (grey line) and in presence of dt-p1 (red line) and dt-p2 (blue line) peptides in dry films. since the peptide:lipid ratio (1:130) is prone to mask peptide secondary structures, we have used the second derivative of atr-ftir to highlight different secondary structures due to mathematical band narrowing. the intense peak at 1685 cm−1 indicates the presence of tfa, used as counter-ion in peptide synthesis. the dotted lines indicate the wavenumber position of regions of interest.full size imagethird, regarding nmr the appearance of both tryptophan and aromatics regions in the dt-p2 peptide 1h spectrum in the presence of 50 mm dpc micelles (fig. 5) was very similar from that for e1 peptide (fig. 5). the e1 moiety in dt-p2 showed a similar chemical shift dispersion/pattern of tryptophan indole nh protons and phe/tyr aromatic protons, in particular phe-13 aromatic protons (in e1p47 nomenclature) upfield shift when dissolved in presence of 50 mm dpc micelles19,27. comparing the nmr spectra of peptides dt-p1 and dt-p2, the spectrum of the former peptide displayed more broadened resonances, as was observed for the loss of chemical shit dispersion for tryptophan side chain nh protons, thereby suggesting an increased aggregation state of this peptide in micelles. to increase solubility, higher amounts of dmso-d6 were used in the final nmr sample (from 3 to 13%), but no improvement was observed.figure 51d 1h nmr spectra of e1, dt-p1 and dt-p2 peptides in dpc micelles (15 mm hepes-d11, ph = 6.0, 1 mm tcep, in 87% h2o/13% dmso-d6 or 87% h2o/10% d2o/3% dmso-d6; 300 k). phe-13 and trp’s nh side chain assignment obtained from our previous work for e119 and tentative assignment for dt-p2 peptide.full size imageto evaluate the aggregation state of both peptides, the translational diffusion coefficients were measured by nmr at low (0.5 mm) concentration for both peptides in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph = 6.0, in 100% d2o: 0.5 mm dss and 1.0 mm tcep) with 50 mm dpc-d38 (table 3). nmr measurements showed that the value of self-diffusion coefficients obtained for dt peptides is in the expected range for a peptide of similar length associated to micelles19,28. the diffusion coefficient of dt-p1 peptide decreases in comparison with the value measured for dt-p2. taking into account that both peptides have the same molecular weight, the slower diffusion indicates that the radius/hydrodynamic volume of dt-p1 is bigger than dt-p2 and that dt-p1 is more aggregated in dpc micelles than dt-p2. also, we observed a decrease in diffusion coefficients for dpc (ch2)n and –ch2-n+(ch3)3 protons from dt-p2/dpc to dt-p1/dpc, which could be indicative of bigger micelles in presence of more aggregated dt-p1 peptide.table 3 translational diffusion coefficient measured by nmr spectroscopy for peptide samples in dpc-d38 (10 mm phosphate buffer ph = 6 in 100% d2o, 1 mm tcep and 0.5 mm dss; 300 k).full size tablein addition to the peptide conformation, it is relevant to carry out membrane affinity studies for the dt-peptides in order to understand their different functional behavior in relation to the e1 peptide.dt-peptides loose the capability of assembly into the model membrane demonstrated by the e1 peptidemembrane affinity was studied monitoring intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (trp) residues after titration with unilamellar vesicles. emission spectra of dt-peptides in buffer showed a maximum at a wavelength that was at least 10 nm blue-shifted related to the maximum emission of the soluble trp derivative n-acetyltryptophanamide (nata) indicating that trp residues in both peptides are basically shielded from water. as illustrated in fig. 6a, fluorescence intensity of trp residues diminished after titration of dt-p1 with liposomes similarly as that of the trp derivative (nata) that was used to monitor the dilution effect after liposome titration. unlike dt-p1, a fluorescence increase of the emission spectra of dt-p2 upon addition of popc liposomes was observed (fig. 6b). nevertheless, the fluorescence increase of the trp residues on the e1 peptide was higher at lower concentrations of lipid vesicles (fig. 6c). the fractional change in peptide intrinsic fluorescence upon titration with liposomes represented in fig. 6d demonstrated that although there is an interaction between dt-p2 peptide and the lipid bilayer that affects the environment of the trp residues, the e1 peptide partitioned stronger into lipid vesicles.figure 6fluorescence emission spectra of dt-p1 (a), dt-p2 (b) and e1 peptide (c) upon titration with popc unilamellar vesicles. black solid line represents 5 µm peptide in hepes buffer; grey and dotted lines corresponds to peptide titration with popc luvs at a concentration ranged from 0.05 mm to 0.6 mm; (d) partitioning isotherms of e1 and dt-peptides estimated from the fractional change in trp fluorescence intensity upon addition of increasing amounts of liposomes. binding experiments were done by triplicate. values of apparent mole fraction partition coefficients were: kx = 2.4 × 105 and kx = 8.2 × 105 for dt-p2 and e1 peptide, respectively.full size imagecollisional quenching of trp by brominated phospholipids was used to assess the accessibility of the peptides to lipids. the quenching of trp fluorescence by brominated lipids was examined after adding the peptides to lipid vesicles composed of 1,2-di-(9-10-dibromo)stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and was evaluated by fluorescence comparison upon addition of the peptides to lipid vesicles composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. as shown in fig. 7, both dt-peptides showed a limited accessibility for the lipids. on the contrary, trp residues of the e1 peptide were highly quenched demonstrating greater peptide accessibility to the hydrophobic inner part of the lipid vesicles. this result is in agreement with previous structural nmr studies of the e1 inhibitor peptide in dpc micelles which indicated that it was lying parallel to the surface, with the negative-charged side chains oriented to the choline head group and the hydrophobic residues pointing to the micelle core19. thus, the quenching of trp residues of the e1 peptide by brominated atoms attached at positions 9 and 10 of the hydrophobic tails of the lipid implies that these trp residues point to the micelle core such as it was previously reported. on the contrary, dt-peptides lose the capability of being soaked inside the lipid vesicles.figure 7peptide trp quenching by brominated lipid vesicles. fractional quenching is shown as mean ± sd of three repeated assays.full size imageas it was previously demonstrated19, the interaction between the e1 fusion inhibitor and its viral target (fp) takes place at the membrane level. the intrinsic fluorescent experiments point out to the necessity that fusion inhibitor peptides that specifically interfere with the n-terminal region of gp41 are embedded within the membrane in order to interact properly with their viral target.the conformational studies carried out in this work demonstrated that dt-p2, which has the e1 sequence on n-terminus, resembles better the helix-turn-helix structure of the e1 inhibitor and maintains better the recognition of both gp41 target sites. the reduced affinity of dt-p1 for the gp41 target sites could be related to its tendency to self-aggregate such as it was demonstrated by the translational diffusion coefficients measured by nmr. in order to reduce the peptide aggregation, longer and more hydrophilic linkers could be used to separate e1 and e2 sequences on novel modified dt- peptides. taking into account that the two target regions are separated by the nhr in gp41, polyethylene glycol-based spacers of different lengths could also facilitate the simultaneous bind of dt-peptides to both targets. however, since the fusion process is progressive it is possible that there is no need to fix the distance between the two inhibitory domains.although dt-p2 is less prone to aggregation in micelles and preserve better the conformational features required for maintaining the antiviral activity than dt-p1, similar inhibition activities in both dt-peptides were found. regarding the antiviral activity of the single e1 peptide, the lower inhibitory activity of both dt-peptides could be related with their lower interaction and assembly into the membrane phospholipids which impairs the recognition of the gp41 target site.conclusion sthe study of the functional behavior of dt-peptides in a membranous environment attending to the peptide recognition of the target sites on gp41, the peptide conformation as well as the peptide affinity to the membrane, lead us to conclude that the lower antiviral activity of the dt-inhibitors compared to single peptides could be related to the peptide affinity and its subsequent assembly into the model membrane. specifically, the insertion of the peptide into the lipid bilayer is a necessary condition for maintaining the recognition of the target sites, mainly the fusion peptide on gp41, and therefore is closely related to the antiviral activity. the overall results point out to the requirement that fusion inhibitor peptides that interfere with those domains in hiv-1, critical for stabilizing the six-helix bundle formation, are embedded into membranes in order to interact with their viral target.methodsthe work was approved by the ethical committee of the consejo superior de investigaciones científicas (csic), madrid, spain. all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of iqac-csic.synthesis, characterization and purification of peptidesthe dual-targeting-peptides were manually synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (spps) using 9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl (fmoc) strategy. dt-p1 and dt-p2 were synthesized as c- terminal carboxamides. elongation of both peptidyl-resins was carried out following the same procedure. thus, couplings were performed by 2-(1h-7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium (hatu) and diisopropylethylamine (dipea) activation, with a threefold molar excess of fmoc-amino acids. amino acid side chain protection was effected by the following: triphenylmethyl (trt) for glutamine, asparagine and cysteine; tert-butyl (tbu) for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine and tyrosine; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulfonyl (pmc) for arginine; and tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc) for lysine and tryptophan. the fmoc deprotection step was performed twice with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (dmf) for 10 min. the stepwise addition of each residue was assessed by kaiser’s (ninhydrin) test and by the chloranil test for identification of secondary amines, when coupling proline residues.a fraction of the dt-p1 and dt-p2 peptidyl-resins were labelled at the n-terminus with 5(6)-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (tamra), previously activated with n,n´-diisopropylcarbodiimide (dipcdi) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (hobt). the coupling reaction was carried out overnight with a threefold excess of the reagents.the peptides were concomitantly side chain deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of 94% (v/v) trifluroacetic acid (tfa), 1% (v/v) triisopropylsilane (tis), 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 2.5% (v/v) water for 3 h with occasional agitation at room temperature. the solvent was removed in vacuum and the crude peptides were precipitated with diethyl ether. the solids were dissolved in 30% acetic acid in water and lyophilized.the crude peptides were purified by semipreparative hplc in an xbridgetm prep c8 column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm, waters). the identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (es-ms). es-ms was performed with a liquid chromatograph–time of flight (lc-tof) detector, lct premier xe (micromass waters, milford, ma, usa), coupled to analytical ultra performance liquid chromatography apparatus (uplc, waters). samples were dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile/water (1/1, v/v) and analysed in the uplc at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. the mass spectra were recorded in positive ion mode in the m/z 500–2500 range. uplc was performed in an acquity uplc beh c18 reverse-phase column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) and with an acquity uplc (waters) chromatograph. solvent a was 20 mm formic acid in water and solvent b was 20 mm formic acid in acetonitrile. elution was performed with linear gradients of 5–100% solvent b into a over 10 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. characterization of the pure peptides es-ms are shown in supplementary figs s1–s4. the peptides were 95% pure by analytical hplc at 220 nm.competitive elisa assaysnunc maxisorp 96-microwell plates (nunc, roskilde, denmark) were used as a support for coating a solution of 0.22 ug/ml of hiv-1 gp41mn protein in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (0.1 m, ph 9.8) overnight at 4 °c. after blocking the wells with 1% (w/v) bsa in phosphate buffer, ph 7.2 with 0.1% tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, peptides diluted in phosphate buffer were added to each well at graded concentration. simultaneously, a solution of f240 monoclonal antibody in phosphate buffer was added to the wells at a 0.04 µg/well concentration. the plates were incubated for one hour and a half at room temperature. after washing three times, anti-human igg conjugated to peroxidase (dako denmark) diluted 1:6000 in phosphate buffer was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. then, the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was incubated for 30 min and the absorbance values were measured at a wavelength of 492 nm. the measurements were taken by triplicate in three different days. the results are expressed as the percentage of inhibition of gp41 binding induced by the peptide.haemolysis assaythe human care of the rabbits used to perform the haemolysis assay with blood samples was carried out according to the guidelines for animal care in the facilities of the iqac-csic.the procedure of the haemolysis assay was performed as described in ref. 11. briefly, concentration solutions of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 µm of each dt- peptide and 100 µm of hiv-1 fp were incubated for 60 min at 37 °c. erythrocytes from rabbit, previously washed with pbs and diluted 1:10 in pbs, were added at a concentration of 10%(v/v) to the peptide solutions and incubated again 60 min at 37 °c. the solutions were centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min and supernatants were transferred to a 96 well maxisorptm plate (nunc). absorbance was quantified at 405 nm. the percentage of haemolysis is expressed relative to the total haemolysis caused by the respective hiv-1 fp alone and is calculated as described in ref. 29. each sample was processed in triplicate and on two different days. haemolysis induced by each dt-peptide incubated with red blood cells without hiv-1 fp was also tested.fluorescence assaysfluorescence assays were performed in a pti fluorescence master systems spectrofluorimeter (photon technology international) using a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette.unilamellar vesicles (luv) composed of the negatively charged phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (popg) or zwitteronic phospholipid palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (popc) (both from avanti polar-lipids) were prepared as model membranes. lipids (10 mm) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) solution. the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. a buffer solution of pbs 0.01 m ph 7.4 was added to the previously obtained lipid film to prompt the spontaneous formation of multilamellar vesicles that were subjected to a process of 10 freeze and thaw cycles. the liposomes were then subjected to an extrusion process through 100-nm pore-sized polycarbonate filters in a high-pressure extruder.to perform fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays, nbd-labelled fp and tamra-labelled dt-peptides were used as donor and acceptor, respectively. the emission spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 450–650 nm upon excitation at λ = 467 nm. nbd fp was added to a 100 µm suspension of luvs to reach a final concentration of 0.5 µm. then, tamra-labelled dt-peptides in doses ranging from 0.15 µm to 1.5 µm were sequentially added to the luv solutions containing the nbd-fp. fluorescent measurements were recorded before and after de addition of tamra-labelled peptides and intensities were corrected by subtraction of the signal produced by the labelled acceptor alone. the contribution of the vesicles was subtracted from every measurement. the percentage efficiency of the energy transfer was determined from the ratio of the donor in the presence and the absence of the acceptor, at the wavelength of the maximal emission of the donor (λ = 530 nm)30.to carry out membrane partition studies with dt-peptides, emission fluorescence spectra were recorded for dt-peptides in pbs (0.01 m, ph 7.4) at 20 °c using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. changes in the tryptophan (trp) fluorescence spectra were monitored after incubation of 5 µm of each peptide with increasing concentrations of liposomes. the suspensions were continuously stirred and were left to equilibrate for 10 min before recording the spectra. fluorescence intensities were corrected by subtraction of the vesicle blank. a lipid titration of n-acetyltryptophanamide (nata) was carried out at the same time. as described in ref. 31, the apparent mole fraction partition coefficients were determined by fitting the binding curves to the equation:$$f={f}_{bound}{f}_{max}+(1-{f}_{bound}){f}_{0}$$where f is the relative fluorescence intensity, f0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of lipid.$${f}_{bound}={k}_{x}l/(w+{k}_{x}l)$$where kx is the mole fraction partition coefficient, l is the lipid concentration, and w is the molar concentration of water (55.3 m at 25 °c).quenching of trp by brominated phospholipid was performed using liposomes composed of 1,2-di-(9-10-dibromo) stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (br-pc) (avanti polar lipids). as previously reported32, this lipid has similar properties as unsaturated phosphatidylcholine chains due to the bulkiness of bromine residues. for this reason, liposomes of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (dopc) were used for comparing the trp fluorescence of peptides with brominated liposomes. liposomes were prepared following the same procedure as described above. comparatively, a concentration of 2 µm of peptides was added to 200 µm of lipid vesicles either brpc or dopc. after 5 min of incubation at 25 °c, fluorescence spectra were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and emission from 300 to 450 nm. the fractional quenching was calculated as reported in ref. 33 by (f0 − f)/f0, where f0 is the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm for peptides added to dopc liposomes and f for peptides added to br-pc liposomes.for fluorescein leakage experiments, liposomes of soy bean phosphatidylcholine (pc) were prepared containing 60 mm fluorescein. at this concentration the dye exhibits autoquenching. multilamellar liposomes, obtained after hydrating the lipid film with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7.4 containing 60 mm fluorescein, were extruded through 100 nm pore polycarbonate membranes. non-entrapped fluorescein was removed by size exclusion chromatography using pd-10 columns with sephadex g-25 (medium), eluted with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7.4 containing 60 mm nacl. typically, a solution of purified liposomes of about 0.65 mm pc was obtained.the effect of the peptides on the pc membranes was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of the purified liposomes after the addition of aliquots of dmso solutions of peptides to a final peptide concentration of 2.5 µm (final dmso content was 10% v/v). since the addition of the peptides caused vesicle disruption, a scattering contribution to the very fluorescence signal was produced. thus fluorescence could not be accurately measured for more than, approximately, 50 minutes. after incubation, triton x-100 was added to the samples in order to solubilize any lipidic structure and to measure their total fluorescence. results are expressed as % of entrapment using the following equation:$$ \% \,{\rm{entrapment}}=100\,(1\,\mbox{--}\,({f}_{i}\,\mbox{--}\,{f}_{0})/({f}_{f}\,\mbox{--}\,{f}_{0}))$$where f0, ff and fi are, respectively, the sample fluorescence at time 0, after triton x-100 addition, and at time i.attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared (atr-ftir) experiments10 µl of fluorescein-free suspensions containing peptide mixed with liposomes (1:130) placed on top of the atr znse crystal, were gently dried under a n2 stream. spectra were obtained at room temperature by the average of 2 blocks of 250 scans each at 2 cm−1 resolution in a varian fts-7000 infrared spectrometer. the second derivative was performed with nine smoothing points.nmr spectroscopynuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectra were recorded at 300 k on a bruker avance iii console (bruker biospin, germany) combined with a 9.7 t oxford instruments magnet (1h 500 mhz), equipped with a 5 mm inverse cryogenically cooled triple-resonance tci (1h, 13c, 15n, and 2h lock) cryoprobe with a z-axis magnetic field-gradient capability. for proton spectra acquisition, peptide samples were prepared by dissolving first lyophilized peptide in a small amount of dmso-d6 and next, dissolution in detergent solution containing perdeuterated dpc-d38 (final molar ratio ~ 1:100, peptide/dpc 0.5:50 mm). the final ph of peptide/detergent aqueous solution (87% h20/10% d20/3% dmso-d6 or 87% h20/13% dmso-d6, 15 mm hepes-d11) was adjusted to 6.2. buffer solution included 1 mm of reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (tcep), to minimize aggregation by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. for diffusion coefficients determination, the field gradient strength (gz) was calibrated by measuring the self-diffusion coefficient of residual h2o in a 100% 2h2o sample at 298.0 k. a diffusion coefficient of 1.91 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for the residual h2o signal was then used for the back calculation of the field gradient strength. diffusion nmr experiments were acquired at 300 k to minimize convection effects. the stebpgp1s19 pulse sequence with watergate 3919 for water suppression and one spoil gradient from bruker library was used. the diffusion coefficient, d, was determined by fitting diffusion weighted intensities of selected peaks or integrals over a chosen range to the following equation$${i=i}_{{\rm{0}}}\exp \{\,-\,{\gamma }^{{\rm{2}}}{{\rm{g}}}^{{\rm{2}}}{{\rm{\delta }}}^{{\rm{2}}}({\rm{\delta }}-{\rm{\delta }}/3)d\},$$

(1), with τ1 being the time interval between the bipolar gradient pulses within the bipolar gradient encoding or decoding segment. fittings to eq. (1) were performed using bruker dynamics center software (bruker biospin, germany), the results are reported below. in the case of dpc, the observed diffusion coefficient is the weighted average of the free (dfree) and bound (dbound) values and$${d}_{{\rm{obs}}}={f}_{{\rm{free}}}{d}_{{\rm{free}}}+{f}_{{\rm{bound}}}{d}_{{\rm{bound}}},$$

A Naturally Occurring Polymorphism in the HIV-1 Tat Basic Domain Inhibits Uptake by Bystander Cells and Leads to Reduced Neuroinflammation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39531-5,Research,1 March 2019,yes,"hiv-1 tat protein contributes to hiv-neuropathogenesis in several ways including its ability to be taken up by uninfected bystander cns cells and to activate inflammatory host genes causing synaptic injury. here, we report that in the globally dominant hiv-1 clade c, tat displays a naturally occurring polymorphism, r57s, in its basic domain, which mediates cellular uptake. we examined the effect of this polymorphism on tat uptake and its consequences for cellular gene transactivation. in decapeptides corresponding to the basic domain, a r57s substitution caused up to a 70% reduction in uptake. we also used a transcellular tat transactivation assay, where we expressed tat proteins of hiv-1 clade b (tat-b) or c (tat-c) or their position 57 variants in hela cells. we quantified the secreted tat proteins and measured their uptake by tzm-bl cells, which provide readout via an hiv-1 tat-responsive luciferase gene. transactivation by tat-b was significantly reduced by r57s substitution, while that of tat-c was enhanced by the reciprocal s57r substitution. finally, we exposed microglia to tat variants and found that r57 is required for maximal neuroinflammation. the r57s substitution dampened this response. thus, genetic variations can modulate the ability of hiv-1 tat to systemically disseminate neuroinflammation.
introduction hiv-1 infection can result in a spectrum of cognitive and behavioral diseases, termed hiv associated neurocognitive disorders (hand)1. hiv-infected cells in the central nervous system (cns) release neurotoxic viral proteins (e.g., gp120 and tat) and a variety of host factors such as inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and small molecules2,3. the incidence of hiv associated dementia (had), the severe form of hand, was originally estimated at 15–30% in combination antiretroviral therapy (cart)-naive hiv patients in the us4. widespread cart usage has led to a decreased had prevalence to 5–10%5,6. there is also a corresponding increase in the prevalence of milder forms of hand. overall, hand is currently estimated at 50% of all hiv-infected individuals7. the severity of hand in the cart era is more closely associated with levels of inflammatory markers and cytokines in the cns rather than with viremia7,8. therefore, the focus of new hand therapies is increasingly on the low-level chronic cns inflammation in hand patients. this inflammation is due to both infected cell populations and uninfected bystander cells, which can be stimulated by viral proteins such as gp120 and tat released by infected cells.hiv tat protein can be detected in the cns of patients receiving cart, even with well-controlled peripheral and cns viral loads9. tat protein plays an important role in neuropathogenesis by recruiting peripheral mononuclear phagocytes (mps) to the cns10,11, leading to an increased cns hiv burden. tat can cause direct neurotoxicity12, synaptic loss13 and induce host proinflammatory genes14. tat protein is secreted from infected cells by a non-canonical process15 and the secreted tat can be taken up by uninfected bystander cells16. tat uptake is largely mediated by its basic domain17. tat is capable of transcellular signaling18,19 in cells relevant to hand: microglia, macrophages and neurons20,21,22,23, thereby propagating inflammation beyond the relatively small population of hiv-infected cells in the cns24. similar to the infected cells, uninfected bystander cells that have internalized tat can upregulate proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as ccl2, tnf-α, il-2, il-6, il-8, il-1β, and cxcl1 among others25,26,27,28,29,30,31.we and others have shown that a naturally occurring polymorphism in tat, a cysteine to serine substitution at residue 31 (c31s) significantly reduces its neuropathogenic potential, diminishing tat’s ability to recruit mps32, its neurotoxicity33,34 and its pro-inflammatory function35,36. we now describe the effects of another natural tat polymorphism. tat contains a 10-amino acid basic region from residues 48 to 57, termed the cell-penetrating peptide (cpp) sequence, which mediates tat uptake by cells. this decapeptide sequence, when covalently linked to a variety of molecular cargoes, facilitates their efficient delivery into cells37,38,39. tat internalization is mediated by its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspg) ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface. negatively charged hspgs coordinate with positively charged arginine and lysine residues in the cpp40,41,42. substitution of even a single basic residue with an alanine drastically reduces the peptide’s uptake by cells37. we previously reported that the r57 tat residue from non-clade c hiv-1 isolates is well-conserved (67%), while in clade c hiv-1 (hiv-1c), the predominant residue is s57 (86%)43. this r57s substitution reduces the number of cpp basic residues (arginine or lysine) from eight in non-clade c tat proteins to seven in tat-c. biological consequences of this substitution are currently unknown. given intracellular tat’s ability to modulate transcriptional processes, any polymorphism that can influence its uptake by proximal uninfected cells could have important consequences for systemic production of proinflammatory factors.in this communication, we have examined the consequences of the naturally occurring r57s substitution on tat uptake by bystander cells via a wider dissemination of inflammation through activation of proinflammatory genes. first, using fluorescently labeled cpp decapeptides containing either r57 or s57, we demonstrated that cpp-r57 peptide is internalized more efficiently than cpp-s57 (3–4 fold), in a process dependent on cpp binding to extracellular hspg and endocytosis. we explored the effect of r57s substitution on the uptake of full-length tat proteins, using a transcellular transactivation assay18 where we show a significant reduction. next, to assess the biological impact of tat-driven transactivation in the context of hiv neuropathogenesis, we exposed microglial cells to media from tat-transfected cells, and observed a higher level of induction of proinflammatory cytokine genes – tnfα, il-6, il-8, il-1β and cxcl1 - in response to the more efficient uptake of tat-r57 when compared to tat-s57. finally, spent media from microglia exposed to r57 tat variants caused a significantly greater neuroinflammation than s57 tat variants. we conclude that the presence of tat residue r57 is important in the dissemination of inflammatory response to uninfected bystander cells in the cns.resultspolymorphism in the tat basic domainprevious work on clade b hiv-1 (hiv-1b) tat cpp uptake has shown that the 6 arginine and 2 lysine residues in the cpp sequence (r49, k50, k51, r52, r53, r55, r56, and r57) are critical for efficient tat uptake. the substitution of even a single arginine/lysine with alanine significantly attenuates cpp uptake37. we analyzed all hiv-1 tat exon 1 sequences available in the los alamos database. analysis (fig. 1) of 6500 cpp sequences across multiple clades shows that among the 8 basic residues in the cpp sequence, the r57 residue was the least conserved. however, when specific clades were examined, r57 was well conserved only in clades b, d and f (93.3%, 76.2% and 91.7% respectively), whereas in clades a, c and g, r57 was respectively present in only 23%, 13% and 9% of the sequences analyzed. instead, the dominant residue in these clades was either a glycine (clades a and g) or a serine (clade c). thus, a significant degree of interclade polymorphism is present at hiv-1 tat cpp residue 57.figure 1group m hiv-1 clades display variation in position 57 of tat cpp sequence. the top panel shows the organization of functional domains in tat. tat is a 101 amino acid protein organized into six distinct domains – acidic, cysteine-rich, core, basic, glutamine-rich and exon 2. numbering at the top is based on hiv-1b tat. on the lower right are weblogo consensus sequences of the basic domain or cpp for each clade, with the relative frequency of each residue proportionally represented by font size in the cpp sequence. on the lower left are the frequencies of amino acid residues (r, s or g) at position 57 in tat protein by clade, with residue frequencies of tat sequences across clades at the bottom.full size imageeffect of r57s substitution on the cellular uptake of tat cpphiv-1c is the dominant clade in the world, responsible for half of the global hiv burden44, and a number of studies have identified genetic features in hiv-1c that attenuate viral functions related to neurovirulence32,33,34,45. therefore, we chose to investigate the effect of the hiv-1c-specific tat r57s polymorphism on cpp uptake. we employed two decapeptides corresponding to residues 48–57 in either tat-b (r57) or tat-c (s57). each decapeptide was n-terminally labeled with a fluorescent tag. differentiated thp-1 monocytic cells were exposed to either cpp-r57 or cpp-s57 at 37 °c for 30 minutes, treated with trypsin to strip away any surface-bound cpp, and imaged by confocal microscopy. cells exposed to cpp-r57 internalized a higher amount of labeled peptide than cells exposed to cpp-s57 (fig. 2a,b). a labeled control peptide daefrhdsgy displayed background levels of uptake.figure 2confocal microscopy reveals differential cellular uptake of tat-cpp-r57 and tat-cpp-s57. incubation of fluorescently labeled tat-cpp peptides with pma-differentiated thp-1 cells indicates a greater internalization of cpp-r57 over cpp-s57. (a) confocal fluorescence microscopy images of cells stained for cell nuclei (dapi, purple), cell membrane (wga-633, red) or of cells exposed to 1 μm of indicated peptide cpp-control, cpp-r57 or cpp-s57 (green) are shown. images were captured at 63x magnification. (b) the total intensity corresponding to the peptide (green signal) was quantified and presented as a sum of all the cells in 3 fields each for control, cpp-r57 and cpp-s57 and plotted. the control peptide uptake was set at 1 and the corresponding increases for the two experimental peptides as compared to control were plotted.full size imagewe quantified the relative uptake of the cpp variants into 293t cells by flow cytometry and observed that cpp-r57 uptake was significantly higher (~3–4 fold) than cpp-s57 (fig. 3a). we incubated 293t and the thp1 cells with increasing concentrations of cpp-r57 and cpp-s57 and observed a linear dose response in cpp uptake (fig. 3b). a reduced uptake of cpp-s57 was seen at all concentrations in both cell lines.figure 3flow cytometry studies indicate a higher uptake of cpp-r57 over cpp-s57 under a variety of conditions. various cell types were incubated with fluorescently labeled cpp peptides and the uptake measured by flow cytometry. (a) 293t cells exposed to 2 μm of a control peptide, cpp-r57 or cpp-s57 peptides followed by analysis by flow cytometry. proportional mfi values between experiments (n = 4) were then averaged and plotted on a histogram. raw mfi values for each sample across different experiments spanned the following ranges: control (1.8–5.5), cpp-r57 (41.9–301.0) and cpp-s57 (11.6–99.0). (b) 293t cells and thp-1 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of cpps as indicated to study dose response. (c) 293t cells exposed to 2 μm of cpps at either 37 °c or 4 °c. data was combined between different experiments (n = 4), and raw mfi values spanned the following ranges: control (2.8–5.3), cpp-r57 (58.8–266.0) and cpp-s57 (20.0–97.3). (d) 293t cells were exposed to cpps at the indicated concentrations of heparin. (e) 293t cells treated for 2 h with the indicated concentrations of heparinase i enzyme (with heparinase iii enzyme included at 1/17 the concentration of heparinase i), then exposed to 2 μm of cpp. data was combined between different experiments (n = 2), and raw mfi values spanned the following ranges: control 0 u (2.1–2.3), cpp-r57 0 u (114.0–145.0), cpp-s57 0 u (18.3–31.9), cpp-r57 1.9 u (64.6–75.1), cpp-s57 1.9 u (7.4–10.9), cpp-r57 3.8 u (46.3–49.9), cpp-s57 3.8 u (6.1–6.8), cpp-r57 7.5 u (34.1–35.4), cpp-s57 7.5 u (5.0–5.2), cpp-r57 15 u (27.8–35.2), and cpp-s57 15 u (4.0–5.0) (***p < 0.001).full size imageas the cellular uptake of cpps is mainly achieved by endocytosis46, we investigated whether the perturbation of endocytosis would differentially affect the uptake of cpp variants. as endocytosis is an atp-dependent process that is inhibited at 4 °c, cpp uptake was measured in 293t cells at 4 °c (fig. 3c) and compared with that at 37 °c. although cpp-r57 uptake was affected more (~75% decrease) than that of cpp-s57 (50%), treatment at 4 °c did not eliminate the uptake of either peptide, suggesting that a fraction of each peptide may be taken up by a non-endocytic mode47,48.since tat cpp uptake is mainly mediated by an interaction with hspgs at the cell surface49, we sought to test the effect of perturbing this interaction on cpp uptake. we first tested the effect of competitive inhibition of cpp uptake by heparin. the 293t cells were incubated with labeled cpps in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble heparin. a dose-dependent inhibition of uptake of both cpp-r57 and cpp-s57 was observed in response to increasing amounts of heparin (fig. 3d). finally, prior to incubating with cpp, 293t cells were treated with increasing amounts of a combination of heparinase i and iii to remove surface hspgs. the uptake of both peptides was inhibited in response to increasing levels of pre-treatment with heparinase enzymes (fig. 3e). interestingly, even treatment with very high amounts of heparinase enzymes did not completely abrogate uptake of either cpp (data not shown), but instead diminished it to a certain baseline level. these results agree with previously reported findings that some tat cpp uptake may occur by means other than one involving hspgs41,46.transcellular transactivationnext, we tested the effect of the r57s polymorphism on the cellular uptake of full-length tat proteins. recombinant purified tat protein is notorious for its problems with solubility, aggregation and potential misfolding50,51. as a more viable approach, we employed a transcellular transactivation assay, in which hela cells are first transiently transfected with equal inputs of expression plasmids encoding tat protein (equivalent to hiv-infected ‘producer’ cells) from the well-studied strain hiv-1ada (hiv-1b) and a patient-derived hiv-1bl-43 (hiv-1c)52. tat produced within eukaryotic cells is naturally modified, folded and secreted into the medium, rendering it functionally superior to recombinant purified tat protein34,53. tat-containing media from producer cells are then applied to tat-responsive tzm-bl cells, which contain an integrated ltr-driven luciferase reporter gene (equivalent to uninfected ‘bystander’ cells). tzm-bl cells produce a reporter signal that is proportional to the amount of tat taken up by cells.we took several steps to validate the transcellular transactivation assay. transcellular transactivation is dependent upon the active secretion of tat from producer cells and its accumulation in the supernatant prior to its uptake. a previous site-directed mutagenesis study identified two motifs critical for its secretion, w11 and an rkk tripeptide (residues 49–51)15. therefore, alanine substitutions were separately introduced at each of the motifs, tat-b-w11a and tat-b-49aaa51, and the resulting mutant tat proteins were tested in our assay. first, tzm-bl reporter cells were directly transfected with these tat expression constructs, to evaluate any possible intrinsic differences in transactivation function. tat-b-wt and tat-b-w11a yielded similar levels of luciferase output upon direct transfection into the reporter cells (supplementary fig. s2a) suggesting that w11a substitution does not affect transactivation when it is produced within the cell. however, tat-b-49aaa51-driven luciferase output was diminished by approximately 90% likely reflecting the essential role of basic residues in tar-binding and transcriptional transactivation. therefore, only tat-b-w11a was useful for testing the impact of perturbing tat secretion on transcellular transactivation. exposure of tzm-bl cells to tat-b-wt produced by hela cells transfected with expression constructs led to a robust degree of transcellular transactivation, while tat-b-w11a led to a ~60% reduction in the level of luciferase induction compared with media containing tat-b-wt (supplementary fig. s2b).since hspgs mediate tat uptake, we next investigated whether competitively inhibiting the interaction between tat and hspgs can inhibit the subsequent reporter signal. tzm-bl cells were exposed to tat-b-wt (produced in hela cells) in the presence of either heparin or its functional analog suramin54. a concentration of 10 μg/ml of heparin was sufficient to diminish transcellular transactivation of extracellular tat to near background levels, whereas 100 μg/ml of suramin had a similar effect (fig. 4). thus, our transcellular transactivation assay is dependent on the hspg-dependent uptake of secreted tat, which leads to the luciferase readout.figure 4transcellular transactivation is dependent on the interaction of tat with hspgs on the recipient cells. transcellular transactivation of tzm-bl cells exposed to media collected from hela cells transfected with tat-b, in the presence of indicated amounts of hspg competitive antagonists suramin or heparin.full size imagein order to facilitate the use of equal levels of tat in the transcellular transactivation, we needed to detect and measure tat in the supernatants in the transcellular transactivation assay. therefore, tat proteins were expressed with a c-terminal c-myc tag. both immunoblotting and elisa were employed. the elisa involved the use of an anti-tat monoclonal antibody that recognizes a tat-c n-terminal epitope in addition to the anti-myc antibodies. in order to ensure equivalent detection of all tat proteins, we introduced mutations in tat-b expression constructs to create amino acid substitutions r7n and k12n of both the wild type and r57s variants. the mutations did not affect the transcriptional transactivation function of tat-b (data not shown). the tat-b variant, optimized for binding to anti-tat-c antibodies with the r7n and k12n mutations, is termed tat-b* in our studies.tat sequences from different clades can vary in their transcriptional transactivation from the ltr. however, residue 57 substitution mutations have been previously shown to affect neither transcriptional transactivation nor nuclear localization55. we directly transfected tzm-bl reporter cells with tat expression constructs with c-terminal myc tags – tat-b* and tat-b* r57s (hiv-1ada) variant, tat-c and tat-c s57r (hiv-1bl43) variant. immunoblot analysis of tzm-bl cells transfected with tat expression constructs demonstrated that both the tat-b* variant proteins accumulated to much higher levels than tat-c and its variant (fig. 5, upper panel). however, neither the r57s substitution in tat-b* nor the s57r substitution in tat-c affected the intracellular levels of the respective tat proteins when tat was introduced directly via transfection (fig. 5, upper panel). ltr-luciferase reporter assays of tzm-bl cells directly transfected with tat expression constructs consistently showed that the transfection of equal amounts of tat expression plasmids results in similar levels of luciferase activity between the tat variants within a clade (fig. 5, lower panel). therefore, despite a lower level of protein detected in cell lysates, tat-c proteins are able to drive a robust level of luciferase reporter comparable to a higher level of tat-b* proteins. this is consistent with previous reports of tat-c being a more potent transcriptional transactivator than tat-b55,56. given the differing capabilities of tat proteins from different clades to drive transcriptional transactivation, we cannot directly use an ltr-reporter signal readout as a proxy for differences in extracellular uptake between tat proteins from different clades. within a clade, however, since residue 57 tat mutations do not alter either the intracellular accumulation or the transcriptional transactivation of either tat-b* or tat-c (fig. 5), measuring ltr-response from cells exposed to extracellular tat appears to be a valid way to examine differences in uptake in tat protein that only differ in residue 57.figure 5intracellular levels of tat protein remain unchanged upon position 57 substitution. upper panel, western blot of cell lysates from tzm-bl cells transfected with equal amounts of tat expression plasmids. size markers are shown on the left. lower panel, ltr-luciferase reporter assays from the lysates of the same cells that correspond to the directly transfected samples in the upper panel (***p < 0.001).full size imagedue to potential variability in tat expression of transfected plasmids and the rates of their secretion into the medium, it was necessary to compare levels of extracellular tat between cells secreting different tat variants before treating reporter cells. therefore, we developed a sandwich elisa, using the c-myc tag and the modified n-termini (to mimic tat-c). elisa provided a robust and reproducible means to assess the relative levels of tat protein variants applied to target cells (fig. 6a). we were able to use these elisa absorbance values as correction factors for luciferase readouts from tzm-bl cells exposed to transfected hela cell supernatants. while the r57s substitution in tat-b* consistently decreased transactivation by a factor of 2 or 3 (~50 to 75%), s57r substitution in tat-c increased the reporter signal by a factor of 2 (~50%) (fig. 6b). given that equal intracellular amounts of the intracellularly expressed wild type and mutant b and c tat proteins yield equivalent levels of luciferase reporter signal (fig. 5), the difference in the signal observed between wild type and position 57 variants of tat (in each clade) observed upon the addition of equal amounts of tat proteins strongly supports differential uptake.figure 6at equivalent inputs, both tat-b * and tat-c proteins maximally transactivate only when r57 is present (a) absorbance values from elisa assay measuring the relative amounts of tat protein in media samples from hela cells transfected with

(c) induction of cytokine mrna transcription in c20 microglial cells exposed to media from hela cells transfected with tat-b*, tat-b* r57s, tat-c or tat-c s57r expression constructs. media samples contained equivalent levels of tat protein, as determined by the elisa results in panel (a). values represent fold-change over expression levels in microglia exposed to untransfected hela cell media. data is representative of 3 independent experiments (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).full size imagedifferential induction of host inflammatory genes by tat-r57 vs. tat-s57as mentioned previously, treatment of various cell types with tat has been observed to enhance the output of many proinflammatory host factors. we compared changes in proinflammatory cytokine transcript levels in h-hu_c20 human microglial cells exposed to tat isogenic variants as a way to assess impact of differential tat uptake on their inflammatory output. when equivalent levels of tat proteins were applied to target cells, we observed a pattern of inflammatory gene induction that resembled the transactivation pattern seen in the luciferase reporter gene expression. tat-b* yielded higher levels of inflammatory cytokine gene transcripts il-6, il-8, il-1β and cxcl1 than tat-b*-r57s. conversely, the s57r substitution in tat-c increased cytokine expression levels (fig. 6c). the biological impact of increased tat uptake efficiency, based on the presence of arginine at position 57, therefore, extends to the transcriptional activation of several cytokines implicated in the chronic inflammation that contributes to hand.effect of tat uptake on neuroinflammationprimary human neuron-astrocyte co-cultures were incubated with spent media from microglia that were exposed to media containing equivalent amounts of tat variants. the cultures thus treated were fixed and stained for neurotubulin to detect neurons, glial cell fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) to detect astrocytes and dapi to detect nuclei. processes of neurons (dendrites and axons) exposed to tat-r57-(tat-b* and tat-c s57r)-treated microglial supernatants were shorter and thinner than those treated with tat s57 (see red arrowheads in tatb wt neurotubulin panels in fig. 7a). they also displayed a more beaded appearance, indicating neuronal damage, while tat-b*-r57s and tat-c-treated neurons displayed thicker and longer dendrites with fewer beaded dendrites (see white arrowheads in control neurotubulin panels in fig. 7a).figure 7effect of position 57 polymorphism in tat b or tat c (r57s vs. s57r in tat-b* or tat c) on neuroinflammation. (a) approximately 50, 000 cells containing a mixed culture of human fetal neurons and glia plated on 35 mm mattek plates were treated with 200 µl of spent medium from tat-exposed microglial cultures. the microglia were earlier incubated with spent media from hela cells producing tat-b*, tat-b*-r57s, tat-c wild type or tat-c-s57r. control panel represents sample derived from expression plasmid lacking tat. neurons were stained with anti-neurotubulin antibodies, astrocytes with anti-gfap antibodies and nuclei with dapi. note that axons/dendrites in tat-b* samples and tat-c s57r are shorter and thinner than the other samples and frequently have beaded appearance (red arrowheads in tat-b* neurotubulin panel), while control, tat-b*-r57s and tat-c wild type samples display thicker and longer axons/dendrites (white arrowheads in control panel) with fewer beaded processes. (b) quantitation of lengths of processes from panel (a) above was done with each of the treatments above and represented as skeletal lengths (using volocity 6.3). data is derived from 50 neurons for each treatment (**<0.005; ****<0.0001).full size imageto quantify these effects, we measured the lengths of un-beaded axons/dendrites in the images of 50 neurons in each sample and the control (volocity 6.3). beaded axons/dendrites are a representation of neuronal dysfunction and synaptic compromise in several diseases including hand57. we found that the axonal/dendritic integrity is significantly compromised in co-cultures treated with conditioned microglial media with tat-r57 compared to tat-s57 variants (fig. 7b). when we measured tnfα protein levels in the supernatants of tat-treated microglia (luminex cytokine detection assay) we detected robust levels of tnfα only in the cases of tat-b* (19.2 ng/ml) and tat-c s57r (19.5 ng/ml) samples, compared with their tat-s57 counterparts – where tnfα was undetectable. finally, we determined the relative levels of tnfα mrna via rt-pcr using limited cycles of amplification followed by quantitation of bands in an agarose gel, which correlates with the tnfα protein levels observed via luminex measurements (fig. 8). thus, there is a direct correlation between tat uptake, proinflammatory cytokine stimulation and neuroinflammation.figure 8measuring the tnfα mrna expression in microglia exposed to tat variants. c20 microglia were exposed to equivalent amounts of the four tat variants along with a negative control, 5 ng pma and lps positive control media followed by rt-pcr of total rna and quantification of tnfα pcr products resolved on an agarose gel using densitometry. band intensities of a housekeeping gene, gapdh were also estimated in each sample. tnfα band intensities were expressed as a ratio of gapdh band.full size imageour results indicate that the presence of an r57 residue allows tat to be taken up more efficiently by uninfected brain microglial cells, enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines compared to tat s57 and propagating neuroinflammation beyond the site of hiv-infected cells.discussion in this report, we describe the functional effects of a polymorphism at residue 57 in the hiv-1 tat cpp motif, which has been shown to mediate the uptake of extracellular tat by bystander/uninfected cells. we used tzm-bl cells, with a tat-responsive ltr reporter to compare the relative uptake of tat residue 57 variants with similar transactivation capabilities (i. e., tat-b*/tat-b*-r57s; tat-c/tat-c-s57r). potential differences in tat protein accumulation and/or efficiency of secretion were obviated by measuring the levels of tat protein variants in the medium via elisa, which allowed us to normalize the luciferase readout in the tzm-bl to the amount of tat protein added. when we treated human microglial cells with tat variants, an r57s substitution reduced the transcriptional transactivation of several proinflammatory cytokine genes. finally we showed that spent media from microglia exposed to tat-r57 proteins were more neuroinflammatory compared to microglia exposed to their tat-s57 counterparts. we propose that the r57s polymorphism has the potential to attenuate cns neuroinflammation. furthermore, s57r substitution in a hiv-1c tat protein reciprocally increased the uptake efficiency of tat-c protein, transcriptional transactivation and subsequent neuroinflammation.the importance of the basic domain (cpp) in tat protein uptake has been well-established17,49,58. tat is known to stimulate proinflammatory gene expression in hiv-infected cells, and it is not surprising that it can activate proinflammatory cytokine genes in bystander cells upon uptake. thus, any cpp polymorphism that affects tat uptake can influence the severity of hiv neuropathogenesis by modifying the extent to which the bystander cells take up tat – and the propagation of a ‘secondary’ inflammatory signal distinct from the infected cells themselves. our sequence analysis showed that tat cpp in hiv-1 clades b, d and f largely retain the full complement of eight arginine/lysine residues previously shown to be required for optimal tat uptake. however, three of the clades, a, c and g displayed either a r57s or a r57g substitution. confocal microscopy with fluorescently labeled peptides showed that the presence of an arginine residue at position 57 is required for optimal uptake by cells because, both the substitutions - r57s (fig. 2) and r57g (data not shown) – significantly decreased tat cpp uptake. in our studies, we focused on r57s and excluded r57g substitution for the following reasons: (i) r57 and s57 residues are present in clade b & d or clade c respectively – which represent important, well-studied clades; (ii) as a proof of principle, we wanted to compare two residues r and s at position 57; (iii) much is known about the neuropathogenesis of clades hiv-1 b (which mainly has arg at this position) and hiv-1c (which mainly has ser at this position; (iv) however, literature on the incidence and mechanisms of hiv-1 clade a or clade g –mediated neuropathology is sparse.cellular entry of cpp-tat, with or without r57, takes place largely through endocytosis, since exposure of cells to peptides at 4 °c severely curtailed the uptake of both cpp-r57 and cpp-s57 peptides. however, incubation at 4 °c had a smaller impact on the efficiency of uptake of cpp-s57 (~50% inhibition) than it did on cpp-r57 (~75% inhibition) uptake. it is possible that these results reflect the differential extent to which endocytosis is used as the major mode of uptake for each peptide, depending upon the presence or absence of r57. while endocytosis is the primary route of cpp entry, there is evidence for non-endocytic uptake as well47,48,59,60. additionally, our microscopy results showed that most of the fluorescence signal in the cpp-treated cells was present in discrete vesicular puncta rather than diffusely present in the cytoplasm. this is consistent with previous data indicating the “dead-end” accumulation of tat-cpp in endosomal vesicles, which lacks other residues in full-length tat protein required for endosomal escape61.a role of hspgs in tat binding to cell surface has been previously established40,41,42. all tissues express hspgs on the cell surface including brain62. moreover, the human fetal neurons employed here for comparison between the effect of uptake of hiv-1 tat variants were from same abortus tissue providing a genetically identical target cells in which to compare the damage due to inflammatory signal elaborated by microglia exposed to tat. therefore, our experiments are comparing the tat variants under identical conditions. thus, secreted tat protein can be used to measure transcriptional readout from hiv-1 ltr in reporter cells, which can serve as an indicator of tat uptake efficiency.viral signatures associated with the severity of hand have been previously described. we have reported a naturally occurring c31s polymorphism in tat dicysteine motif in hiv-1c, which is considered to be important for monocyte chemotaxis function – a property that may underlie the increased monocyte infiltration in cns that is a hallmark of had43. in vitro33,35, virological63 and animal model32 studies have generated robust evidence that tat dicysteine motif plays an important role in hiv neuropathogenesis. tat dicysteine motif facilitates tat binding to the ccl2 receptor ccr245 to attract more monocytes and macrophages to the cns sites increasing the inflammatory burden via producing a critical mass of hiv-infected macrophages. this dicysteine motif also binds the glutamate receptor nmda-r34 causing increased calcium currents and loss of neuronal termini due to over-firing64. while c30s31 mutation does not abrogate transcriptional transactivation from hiv-1 ltr, it disrupts the ability of tat to bind to ccr2 and nmda-r and cause neuroinflammation via these two distinct mechanisms. here we describe how a tat polymorphism can modulate a third pathway of neuroinflammation following the endocytosis of tat protein leading to transcriptional transactivation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. our work demonstrates that the induction of inflammatory genes in microglia and subsequent neuronal inflammation from the microglial media is maximized when tat contains an r57 residue. thus, the c30c31 motif mediates neurovirulence either directly by binding to nmda-r or indirectly via binding ccr2 in monocytes or macrophages, while a full complement of basic domain including the r57 residue when present, allows optimal internalization in bystander cells that then leads to transcriptional transactivation of cellular genes. while it is challenging to quantify the relative impact of each of these motifs on neuroinflammation due to the complex modes of action of c30c31 involving different cell types, this would be an important line of future investigation. neuropathogenic outcomes are likely determined by the net effect of neurovirulence signatures in multiple viral genes in addition to contribution from host factors.our findings suggest that tat r57 is an important viral signature of hand severity, because of its ability to modulate uptake, which in turn affects expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in bystander cells in the cns. the data showed that efficient uptake of the r57 tat leads to a commensurate increase in proinflammatory cytokines being released. it is well-known that proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tnf-α) are neurotoxic. thus, our data shows the need for tat to maintain r57 in the cns-compartmentalized variants. while we have shown the effect of this polymorphism in vitro, further work on the in vivo impact of residue 57 polymorphisms on neuroinflammation needs to be conducted employing an in vivo model system such as humanized mouse or non-human primate models. studies comparing tat sequences from the cns of hiv-infected individuals, both with and without hand, could also reveal whether r57 is associated with hand. although such systematic studies have yet to be conducted, we were able to generate some preliminary insight from sequences available at the lanl sequence database. while the overall occurrence of r57 in hiv-1c is 12.8% (fig. 1; n = 1125), tat sequences obtained from the cns of indian hiv-1c patients showed a much higher incidence of r57: 70.6%. while the small sample size of this group (n = 17) necessarily limits the strength of any conclusion s, we were intrigued by the apparent enrichment of r57 in cns-derived tat sequences from hiv-1c-infected individuals with neurological complications. comparatively, tat sequences obtained from brain tissue of hiv-1b patients (n = 69) showed a similarly high incidence of tat-r57 compared with overall sequences (95.6% and 93.3%, respectively). this information is now presented as a figure in the supplementary data (supplementary fig. s3). it is possible that the incidence of hand in hiv-1c patients is associated with a neurovirulence signature that includes an s57r mutation in tat. a longitudinal study, following hiv-patients infected with hiv-1b or hiv-1c hiv and correlating compartment-specific signatures of tat with neurocognitive deficits could address this question.even while cart is able to efficiently suppress cns viral loads, small amounts of tat can still be detected in the cns9. this activity of tat protein can disseminate a constitutive inflammatory signal through bystander cell uptake and activation. moreover, tat taken up by neurons can traffic through axonal transport, allowing tat-mediated inflammation to propagate to sites distal from infected cells65. while the full-blown hiv dementia that previously characterized a substantial proportion of uncontrolled infections has largely receded with antiretroviral treatment, the prevalence of milder forms of hand has significantly increased. the longer lifespans of cart-treated patients mean that their cns is exposed to a low level of chronic exposure to tat protein.thus, tat is an attractive candidate for targeted therapy for cns hiv disease, because of its persistence in virologically suppressed individuals and its ability to elicit inflammation from uninfected cells. the spread of tat from infected cells to uninfected cells presents a possible target for intervention, whereby agents (such as nucleic acid aptamers or antibodies) that can be delivered into the cns and that are able to competitively bind tat could prove effective in diminishing the uptake of tat by bystander cells. recent work from s. valente and coworkers has identified didehydro-cortistatin a (dca), a steroidal analog, which is able to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier, bind to the basic region of tat and inhibit its ability to transactivate transcription. this group has shown the efficacy of dca in displacing the nucleolar localization of tat, and in inhibiting the tat-mediated dysregulation of inflammatory signaling66.in summary, our results show that the polymorphism at tat residue 57 can modify the uptake of secreted tat. the efficiency of tat uptake by uninfected bystander cells can play an important role in the overall cns inflammatory burden, which has been shown to be more predictive of hand severity than viremia levels. extracellular tat in the cns also presents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention designed to diminish chronic inflammatory toxicity and slow or prevent the development of hand."
A majority of HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy is due to infected cell proliferation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06843-5,Research,16 November 2018,yes,"antiretroviral therapy (art) suppresses viral replication in people living with hiv. yet, infected cells persist for decades on art and viremia returns if art is stopped. persistence has been attributed to viral replication in an art sanctuary and long-lived and/or proliferating latently infected cells. using ecological methods and existing data, we infer that >99% of infected cells are members of clonal populations after one year of art. we reconcile our results with observations from the first months of art, demonstrating mathematically how a fossil record of historic hiv replication permits observed viral evolution even while most new infected cells arise from proliferation. together, our results imply cellular proliferation generates a majority of infected cells during art. therefore, reducing proliferation could decrease the size of the hiv reservoir and help achieve a functional cure.
introduction antiretroviral therapy (art) limits hiv replication leading to elimination of most infected cd4+ t cells1. yet, some infected cells persist and are cleared from the body extremely slowly despite decades of treatment2,3. there is debate whether infection remains due to hiv replication within a small population of cells4,5 or persistence of memory cd4+ t cells with hiv integrated into human chromosomal dna3,6,7. if the latter mechanism predominates, prolonged cellular lifespan and/or cellular proliferation may sustain stable numbers of infected cells.to optimize hiv cure strategies, mechanisms sustaining infection must be understood. persistent viral replication in a sanctuary where art levels are inadequate implies a need to improve art delivery8. if hiv persists without replication as a latent reservoir of memory cd4+ t cells, then survival mechanisms of these cells are ideal therapeutic targets. infected cell longevity might be addressed by reactivating the hiv replication cycle9 and strengthening the anti-hiv immune response, leading to premature cellular demise. anti-proliferative therapies could limit homeostatic or antigen-driven proliferation10,11,12.these competing hypotheses have been studied by analyzing hiv evolutionary dynamics. due to the high mutation rate of hiv reverse transcriptase and large viral population size13, hiv replication produces high viral diversity13,14,15. new strains predominate due to continuous positive immunologic selection pressure. repeated selective sweeps cause genetic divergence, or a positive molecular evolution rate16, measured by increasing genetic distance between the consensus and founder virus17,18,19.one study documented new hiv mutants during months 0–6 of art in three participants at a rate equivalent to pre-art. new mutations were noted across multiple anatomic compartments, implying widespread circulation of evolving strains4. one proposed explanation was a drug sanctuary in which art levels were insufficient to stop new infection events. alternative interpretations were experimental error related to pcr resampling, or variable cellular age structure within the phylogenetic trees20,21.in other studies of participants on art for at least one year, viral evolution was not observed despite sampling multiple anatomic compartments22,23,24,25. identical hiv dna sequences were noted in samples obtained years apart14,26,27, suggesting long-lived latently infected cells as a possible mechanism of persistence3,6,7,24,25. clonal expansions of identical hiv dna sequences were observed, demonstrating that cellular proliferation generates new infected cells4,12,24,28,29,30. multiple, equivalent sequences were noted in blood, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt), and lymph nodes, even during the first month of art24,29,30.the majority of these studies relied on sequencing single hiv genes which may overestimate clonality because mutations in other genome segments could go unobserved17,31. these studies also measured total hiv dna. however, a majority of hiv dna sequences have deleterious mutations and do not constitute the replication-competent reservoir32,33. a recent study utilized whole-genome sequencing to confirm abundant replication-competent sequence clones34. in another cohort, rebounding hiv arose from replication-competent clonal populations35.another approach to define hiv clonality involves sequencing the hiv integration site within human chromosomal dna36,37,38,39,40. while hiv tends to integrate into the same genes39,41, it is extremely unlikely that two infection events would result in integration within precisely the same chromosomal locus37. thus, integration site analyses eliminate overestimation of clonality. previous studies found significant numbers of repeated integration sites, providing strong evidence that these infected cells arose from cellular proliferation42,43, though replication competency of the virus was not confirmed39. these studies documented equivalent sequences in a minority (<50%) of observed sequences, leading to the conclusion  that proliferation only partially drives hiv persistence.here, we identify that incomplete sampling leads to underestimation of the true proportion of clonal sequences. using ecologic tools, we show that nearly all observed unique sequences are actually members of clonal populations derived from cellular proliferation. we predict that the hiv reservoir consists of a small number of massive clones, and a massive number of small clones. we next design a mechanistic mathematical model to reconcile apparent evolution during the early months of art with clonality after a year of art. the model includes all proposed mechanisms for hiv persistence including a drug sanctuary, long-lived infected cells, and proliferating infected cells. the model highlights that observed hiv evolution during the first 6 months of art is caused by sampling long-lived cells that were generated by viral replication. sampling early during art detects a positive molecular evolution rate due to the fossil record of past infections rather than current viral replication. after one week of art, a majority of new infected cells are generated by proliferation. while it is impossible to rule out an unobserved drug sanctuary, our results suggest that cellular proliferation predominantly drives hiv persistence on art. consequently, anti-proliferative therapies embody a meaningful approach for hiv cure.resultsgenetic signatures of hiv persistencewhen hiv infects a cell, it integrates its dna into human chromosomal dna44. a majority of new infected cells are marked by novel integrated hiv sequences and unique integration sites in terms of chromosomal location (fig. 1) due to the high error rate of hiv reverse transcriptase and the integration process. thus, a signature suggesting that ongoing viral replication (perhaps due to inadequate drug delivery to certain micro-anatomic regions) sustains the hiv reservoir on art would be the observation of continual accrual of new mutations during art.fig. 1genetic signatures of hiv persistence during art. viral replication despite antiretroviral therapy (art) would lead to accrual of new mutations (hiv sequence color change) and novel chromosomal integration sites in newly infected cells. longevity of latently infected cells maintains sequences and integration sites. cellular proliferation of latently infected cells produces clonal populations carrying identical hiv sequences in identical integration sitesfull size imagein a subset of infected cd4+ t cells, hiv replication does not progress beyond chromosomal integration and the virus enters latency44. if the same hiv sequences (or integration sites) are found over long-time intervals, this provides a signature that latent cell longevity or proliferation allows hiv to persist. if equivalent hiv sequences with identical chromosomal integration sites are identified in multiple cells, this provides a signature that these sequences were generated via cellular proliferation, rather than hiv replication (fig. 1).as another approach, we contrast the impact of hiv replication and cellular proliferation on hiv persistence during art by quantifying the numbers or fractions of unique and equivalent sequences. human dna polymerase has much higher copying fidelity than hiv reverse transcriptase. thus, we assume cells arising from viral replication will contain unique sequences while cells arising from cellular proliferation will contain equivalent sequences and be members of clonal populations.hiv dna as a marker of replication-competent hiv clonalitymost integrated hiv dna carries mutations that render the virus replication incompetent. quantification of total hiv dna overestimates the size of the replication-competent reservoir by 2–3 orders of magnitude relative to viral outgrowth assays32. replication incompetent, equivalent hiv sequences are commonly present in multiple cells24,29. because these sequences are terminally mutated, they are concrete evidence that another mechanism (cellular proliferation) copies hiv dna. the proportion of clonal sequences is similar when analysis includes only replication-competent sequences, or all hiv dna34. therefore, while total hiv dna may not predict quantity of replication-competent viruses, estimates of clonal frequency using total hiv dna may be extrapolated to the replication-competent reservoir33. we use total hiv dna as it allows a greater sample size for analysis.clonal hiv dna and replication-competent hiv during artto examine the clonal structure of total and replication-competent hiv dna, we ranked observed sequences from several studies according to their abundance. so-called rank-abundance curves are ordered histograms denoted a(r) such that a(1) is the abundance of the largest clone. these curves facilitate identification of the richness r = max(r), sample size \(n = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_r a\left( r \right)\), and number of singletons \(n_1 = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_r i[a(r) = 1]\). here i[·] is the indicator function equal to 1 when its argument is true and 0 otherwise.wagner et al.37 sampled hiv dna in three participants at three time points 1.1–12.3 years following art initiation. maldarelli et al.36 sampled hiv dna from five participants at one to three time points 0.2–14.5 years following art initiation. in these studies, 1–16% (mean: 7%) of sequences were members of observed sequence clones (fig. 2a)36,37, meaning that hiv dna was in the same chromosomal integration site in at least two cells. the absolute number of observed sequence clones ni>1 in the 17 samples ranged from 1–150 (mean: 15). the remaining sequences were identified in a specific chromosomal integration site in only one cell (observed singletons)37. for total hiv dna, at each participant time point, certain sequences predominated: the largest observed clone contained 2–62 sequences (mean: 11), accounting for 3–26% (mean: 9%) of total observed sequences.fig. 2evidence for clonal hiv sequences. a total hiv dna from integration site data36,37 arranged as rank-abundance curves. each panel represents a participant, and each curve the time point during art (indicated in years in the panel legend). w and m in the panel headings distinguish the study. b similar rank-abundance curves for replication-competent hiv dna34. each panel represents a participant. data used for analysis in figs. 3 and 5 (noted by asterisks in panel titles) have sample size n > 20 sequences. c, d sample sizes of total hiv dna (c) and replication-competent hiv dna (d) at each participant time point plotted against corresponding observed sequence richness. for all hiv dna data and replication-competent hiv dna data with sufficient sampling (n > 20), the observed richness is less than the sample size (below the dotted line y = x), owing to the presence of sequence clones. observed richness correlates with sample size, indicating further sampling consistently uncovers new sequences. e, f sample rarefaction curves for all 17 time points from the 8 study participants from a and five sufficiently sampled study participants from b. rarefaction demonstrates the number of distinct integration sites or hiv sequences expected from a given sample size. for both data sources, at low sample size, distinct sequences are expected from each new sample. as sample size increases, distinct sequences are increasingly less likely to be detected owing to the presence of repeatedly detected sequence clones. thus, curves increasingly flatten until all unique sequences are detected and the curve is completely flat. all colors correspond to data in a and bfull size imagehosmane et al.34 sequenced replication-competent hiv isolates from 12 study participants on art: 0–28% (mean: 11%) of sequences were members of observed sequence clones (fig. 2b). three participants did lack clones, which might reflect low sequence sample size. as a result, we excluded participants with fewer than 20 total sequences from individual analyses but did include these data for population level evaluations. for replication-competent hiv in the five individuals having sequence sample size n > 20, certain sequences dominated: the largest observed sequence clone contained 3–9 sequences (mean: 6.8), accounting for 11–42% (mean = 28%) of total observed sequences. the number of non-singleton sequence clones ni>1 in the five samples ranged from 1–7 (mean: 3.8).low sampling depth relative to total sequence populationlarger sample sizes exist for total hiv dna (fig. 2c) than for replication-competent hiv (fig. 2d). both for total hiv dna and the five included replication-competent data sets (where n > 20), the number of observed unique sequences (robs or observed sequence richness) was always less than n (fig. 2c, d). in both cases, observed richness (robs) correlated with sequence sample size (n) (fig. 2c, d). thus, we infer that further sampling would uncover new unique sequences. to quantify the relationship between sample size and discovery, we calculated rarefaction curves (fig. 2e, f: see methods and supplementary methods for details). these curves relate expected sequence discovery and sample size. at low sample size, each additional sample likely uncovers a new sequence. as sampling increases, the chance of sampling a previously documented sequence increases, and the slope of the rarefaction curve begins to flatten. as sample size approaches the true population richness, the curve plateaus and few new unique sequences remain unsampled. current sampling depth remains on the steep, initial portion of the curve (fig. 2c, d).lower bounds of true hiv sequence richnessto estimate a lower bound for true sequence richness, we used the chao1 estimator, a nonparametric ecologic tool that uses frequency ratios of observed singletons n1 and doubletons n2 (see methods and supplementary methods)45,46. for the hiv reservoir, theoretical values for true richness range from one (if all sequences are identical and originate from a single proliferative cell) to the total population size (if all sequences are distinct and originate from error-prone viral replication). estimated lower bounds for true sequence richness exceeded observed richness, typically by an order of magnitude in both total hiv dna and replication-competent hiv (fig. 3). these lower bound estimates for sequence richness are far lower than previously estimated population sizes for hiv dna and replication-competent hiv dna sequences2,3,6, suggesting that clones may predominate. asymmetric confidence intervals for these estimates are detailed in the supplementary methods.fig. 3observations underestimate the number of distinct hiv sequences during art. observed sequence richness underestimates the true hiv sequence richness. for both data sources, chao1 provides an estimate of the lower bound (min) of true sequence richness (error bars are asymmetric confidence intervals, see supplementary methods). in all cases, chao1 estimates are above observed values. our conservative modeling technique estimates a much higher upper bound (max) for true sequence richness. nevertheless, the total hiv sequence population size (dashed lines: 109 for total hiv dna and 107 for replication-competent hiv) is 1–2 orders of magnitude above the upper bound estimates for sequence richness, suggesting substantial clonality of hiv sequences. all marker colors correspond to data in fig. 2a and bfull size imagea majority of observed sequences are clonalthe chao1 estimator does not integrate information about the total population size. however, estimates for the total number of total hiv dna and replication-competent sequences in the entire reservoir exist33. using that additional information, we developed an ecologic model to extrapolate the true rank-abundance of hiv sequences for each participant time point.based on the observation that observed data was roughly log-log-linear (fig. 2a), we chose a power-law model for rank-abundance: a(r) ∝ r−α. other simple functional forms were explored (exponential, linear, and biphasic power-law) but were worse or equivalent for data fitting. our model requires three parameters: the power-law exponent (α), the sequence population size (l), and the sequence richness (r). model fitting is described in the methods with additional detail in the supplementary methods. briefly, we generated 2500 possible models for each data set, choosing a plausible fixed population size from available data (l = 109 for hiv dna and l = 107 for intact, replication-competent hiv dna)2,3,6,33,47. we then recapitulated the experiment by taking n random samples from each model distribution and comparing sampled data to experimental data to find optimal model parameters. this resampling method correctly inferred the power-law exponent from simulated power-law data (supplementary fig. 1).for experimental data, we could not precisely identify r. recognizing this uncertainty, we developed an integral approximation to estimate the largest possible richness (least clonality) given l and the best-fit α (derivation in supplementary methods and illustration in supplementary fig. 2). using the lower bound estimate from the chao1 estimator, we were able to fully constrain the estimate of true hiv sequence richness in the reservoir. our maximal estimates for sequence richness were notably several orders of magnitudes higher than chao1 estimates (fig. 3) but lower than the total sequence population size (l).our method demonstrated excellent fit to cumulative proportional abundances of observed clones for total hiv dna (fig. 4a) and replication-competent hiv dna (fig. 5a). for total hiv dna (fig. 4b) and replication-competent hiv dna (fig. 5b), optimal fit was noted within narrow ranges for the power-law slope parameter but across a wide range of true sequence richness. using the five best-fit models, we generated extrapolated distributions of the entire hiv sequence rank-abundance for all participant time points. for the participant in fig. 4c, between 104 and 107 clones were needed to reach 100% cumulative abundance. the ratio of these estimates of true sequence richness to the total number of infected cells with hiv dna (109), or r/l, represents an upper bound on the fraction of sequences that are true singletons: we estimate that >99% of infected cells contain true clonal sequences. similarly, the ratio of estimated true sequence richness to the total number of infected cells with replication-competent hiv for the participant in fig. 5c was 105/107. hence, at least 99% of cells are members of clonal populations. of note, these ratios are relatively stable regardless of assumed reservoir size. for instance, if we assume a true reservoir size of 106, then our estimate of true sequence richness is ~104. in these examples, the best-fit models gave similar estimates for the population size of the largest clones—those accounting for ~50% of the reservoir—103 to 104 clones for hiv dna in fig. 4c and 2–20 clones for replication-competent hiv dna in fig. 5c. however, the tail of the reservoir, which consists of thousands of smaller clones, could vary considerably across parameter sets with 104 to 106 possible clones accounting for 90% of total hiv dna and 102 to 104 possible clones accounting for 90% of replication-competent hiv. this variability reflects the fact that true sequence richness is only partially identifiable using our procedure. the extrapolated rank-abundances for each representative data set are presented in figs. 4d and 5d.fig. 4ecologic modeling suggests a majority of hiv dna sequences are clonal. to describe the true rank-abundance

of massive clones (top 100 clones) each consist of >103 cells and a massive number of smaller clones (~105) each consist of many fewer cells (<100)full size imagewe applied our model fitting procedure to all data in fig. 2a and sufficiently sampled data in fig. 2b (see asterisks). we biased against a clonally dominated reservoir to the greatest extent possible by selecting the best fitting power-law exponent and then calculating the maximum possible sequence richness (see details in supplementary information and supplementary fig. 2). for all cases, even under this conservative assumption, the vast majority of sequences were predicted to be members of true sequence clones. the power-law exponent was lower for hiv dna (α = 0.9 ± 0.1) than for replication-competent hiv dna (α = 1.4 ± 0.2) on average. here, errors (±) represent standard deviation across 17 and 5 participant data sets, respectively. as a result, the predicted cumulative distribution of hiv dna (fig. 4e) was often concave-up with log rank as compared to concave-down with log rank noted for replication-competent hiv dna (fig. 5e), suggesting that a smaller number of extremely large clones might make up a higher proportion of the replication-competent hiv reservoir.for both total hiv dna (fig. 4f) and replication-competent sequences (fig. 5f), the top 100 clones in all participants are estimated to be massive (>105 and >104 associated cells, respectively). however, there are also massive numbers of smaller clones with fewer than 1000 associated cells (>107 and >104, respectively). in contrast to observed data, a majority of sequences are clonal, suggesting that proliferation is the major generative mechanism of persistent hiv-infected cells.modeling combined population datato increase sample size and eliminate bias related to excluding participants with low sample sizes, we combined results from all participant time points for hiv dna (17 time points) and replication-competent hiv (12 time points) into single rank order distribution curves. we then fit the power-law models to both sets of data (supplementary fig. 3a, b, e, f). we again noted a narrow range of possible values for the power-law exponent and a large range of possible values for true sequence richness. the exponent was again α < 1 for total hiv dna and α ≈ 1 for replication-competent virus (supplementary fig. 3a, e), leading to concave-up and linear relationships between log cumulative proportional abundance and log rank, respectively (supplementary fig. 3c, g). we estimated that at least 99.9% of total hiv dna (supplementary fig. 3c) or replication-competent hiv (supplementary fig. 3g) contain true clonal sequences. the top 100 hiv dna clones (supplementary fig. 3d) and replication-competent clones (supplementary fig. 3h) contained >106 and >104 associated cells, respectively.using the population level data, we generated sample rarefaction curves from the extrapolated rank-abundance curves. these curves show that after 10,000 sequences were sampled, the observed sequence richness would continue to increase with more sampling (supplementary fig. 4). even if experimental sample sizes could be increased 100-fold from the present data, sequences would likely continue to be dominated by those from large clones. our methods, or other inference techniques, may therefore be necessary to realistically estimate the clonal distribution of the hiv reservoir.mathematical model of persistent infected cell dynamicsour analyses above identify the critical role of cellular proliferation in generating infected cells after a year of art but do not capture the dynamic mechanisms underlying this observation or explain possible evidence of viral evolution during months 0–6 of art4. we therefore developed a viral dynamic mathematical model. our model (fig. 6a) consists of differential equations, described in detail in the methods. most model parameter values are obtained from the literature (table 1).fig. 6mechanistic modeling of hiv rna decay during art. a model schematic: i1 cells produce virus, pre-integration latent cells i2 are longer lived and transition to i1, and long-lived latently infected cells i3(j) proliferate and die at measured rates depending on cell phenotype j (e.g., effector memory, central memory, naive). sanctuary cells is allow ongoing hiv replication despite art. parameters and their values are discussed in the methods and listed in table 1. b the mathematical model recapitulates observed hiv rna data51 over weeks and years of art. v1 is virus derived from i1 while vs is derived from is. c i3 becomes the predominant infected cell state early during art. is is constrained to be very small to explain the lack of detectable viremia on fully suppressive art. lines are colored to match schematic in afull size imagetable 1 model parametersfull size tablebriefly, we classify rapid death δ1 and viral production within actively infected cells i1. cells with longer half-life i2 are activated to i1 at rate ξ2. i2 may represent cd4+ t cells with a prolonged pre-integration phase, but their precise biology does not affect model outcomes48. the state i3(j)represents latently infected cells. we assume each cell carries a single chromosomally integrated hiv dna provirus44. the probabilities of a newly infected cell entering i1, i2, i3(j), are τ1, τ2, τ3(j). because we are focused on the role of proliferation, we include cd4+ t cell subsets12 including effector memory (tem), central memory (tcm), and naive (tn) cd4+ t cells, which have been experimentally proven to turn over at different rates α3(j), δ3(j)12,42,43. we assume all subsets i3(j) reactivate to i1 at rate ξ349.we allow art potency \({\it{\epsilon }} \in [0,1]\) to decrease viral infectivity50. other dynamic features of infection such as death rate of infected cells and latent cell proliferation and reactivation rates are unchanged on art. on art, the basic reproductive number becomes \(r_0\left( {1 - {\it{\epsilon }}} \right) < 1\) when \({\it{\epsilon }} > 0.95\). in a completely susceptible population a reproductive number <1 implies each cell infects fewer than one other cell on average and viral loads decline from steady state. in this setting, only short stochastic cycles of viral replication can occur.to make a model inclusive of viral evolution despite art, we allow for the possibility of a drug sanctuary state (is) that reproduces with reproductive number \(r_0\left( {1 - {\it{\epsilon }}_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) \approx 8\). in the drug sanctuary, art potency is negligible \(({\it{\epsilon }}_{\mathrm{s}} \approx 0)\) such that the sanctuary reproductive number is equivalent to the value from a model without art. however, target cell limitation or a local immune response causes a sanctuary viral set point to prevent infected cells and viral load from growing unabated. in the absence of contradictory information, we assumed homogeneous mixing of v1 and vs in blood and lymph nodes4. thus, we find that the sanctuary size must be limited to 0.001–0.01% of the original burden of replicating hiv to achieve realistic viral decay kinetics (fig. 6b)51.based on the observation that activated, uninfected cd4+ t cells (s), the targets for replicating hiv, decrease in numbers after initiation of art we also perform a subset of model simulations with a slow target cell decline within the hiv drug sanctuary. we approximate this process with an exponential decay of target cells with rate ζ (per day)52,53. the decay rate is lower than concurrent decay rates measured from hiv rna50,51,54 because abnormal t cell activation persists for more than a year after art53.accurate simulation of hiv dynamics during artwe fit the model to ultra-sensitive viral load measurements collected from multiple participants in palmer et al.51. we included experimentally derived values for most parameter values (table 1), solving only for activation rates ξ2 and ξ3 by fitting to viral load. simulations reproduce three phases of viral clearance (fig. 6b) and predict trajectories of infected cell compartments (fig. 6c). the model fit is flexible to assumptions of starting values of the three infected cell compartments (the relative proportion of which are unknown pre-art): in this circumstance, we arrive at different values of ξ2 and ξ3 without impacting overall model conclusion s regarding the hiv reservoir. the size of the sanctuary (expressed as the fraction of infected cells φs) is only constrained to be below a value <10−5 to ensure accurate model fit for a static sanctuary model. this value can be higher for a decaying sanctuary (fig. 7a, third column).fig. 7most infected cells are generated via proliferation within 6 months of art initiation. model simulations contrast the number of cells generated by viral replication with those generated by cellular proliferation. the fraction of cells that arose due to viral replication at a time point is referred to as the current replication percentage. the fraction of cells remaining that arose at any time due to viral replication is referred to as the net replication percentage. simulations are identical except for different assumptions regarding a drug sanctuary (is) in each column. a moving left to right, we assume a static drug sanctuary, a slowly declining drug sanctuary and no drug sanctuary. b under all assumptions, once art is initiated, most current infected cells arise due to cellular proliferation as opposed to hiv replication after 12 months of art. c current latently infected reservoir cells (i3) are generated almost entirely by proliferation soon after art is initiated under all conditions. d the fraction of cells that remain that were generated by replication at any time (net) overestimates the fraction generated current percentage during the first 6 months of art—a trend that is more notable when the reservoir contains a higher proportion of slowly proliferating naive t cells. importantly, this is the quantity that would be observed experimentally (see fig. 8). e pie charts indicate reservoir compositions of t cell subsets from published data and correspond with colored lines in a–dfull size imagecellular proliferation sustains hiv infection during artwe next used the model to estimate the fraction of cells generated by cellular proliferation versus viral replication. we conservatively assumed that prior to art all infected cells were generated by viral replication. then, we tracked the number of cells whose origin was replication and the number whose origin was cellular proliferation. without directly simulating a phylogeny, the fraction of all cells that derive from replication provides a surrogate for the expected fraction of cells that would give a signal of evolution. we also distinguish the current replication percentage, the fraction of infected cells currently being generated from viral replication, from the net replication percentage, the fraction of total infected cd4+ t cells remaining at a given time whose origin was hiv replication. this distinction contrasts the surviving, historically infected cells with those presently being generated via hiv infection. because many long-lived cells were once generated by hiv infection, the net replication percentage typically exceeds the current replication percentage.we simulated the model under several plausible sanctuary and reservoir conditions to assess the relative contributions of infection and cellular proliferation in sustaining infected cells. we considered different reservoir compositions based on evidence that effector memory (tem), central memory (tcm), and naive (tn) cells proliferate at different rates and that distributions of infection in these cells differ among infected patients12,42,43. further, because a drug sanctuary has not been observed, its true volume is unknown and may vary across persons. we therefore conducted simulations with a static sanctuary, a slowly diminishing sanctuary, and no drug sanctuary (fig. 7a).regardless of assumed pre-treatment reservoir composition and sanctuary size, the contribution of replication to generation of new infected cells is negligible after one year of art. the contribution of current replication diminishes rapidly with time on art regardless of whether a sanctuary is assumed (fig. 7b). the fraction of long-lived latently infected cells (i3) generated by viral replication (fig. 7c, note log scale) is negligible within days of art initiation. this finding captures the extent of the impact of proliferation even when a sanctuary is assumed.a fossil record of prior replication eventsin all simulations, the net fraction of cells generated from viral replication rather than cellular proliferation at 6 months of art (5–25% in fig. 7d) is higher than the current percentage generated by replication (fig. 7b). a higher fraction of slowly proliferating tn cells exacerbates the difference between historical and contemporaneous generation of infected cells (fig. 7d, green line). because the net fraction is what will be observed experimentally, the model reveals why ongoing evolution might be observed even while the dominant mechanism sustaining the reservoir is cellular proliferation. in keeping with the first section of our paper, after 12 months of art, the net and current percentage of infected cells generated by hiv replication become negligible for all simulated parameter sets. the lag between net and current viral replication generation emerges whether or not a small drug sanctuary is included in the model.we refer to the phenomenon that long-lived cells may contain signatures of past viral replication as the fossil record. to emphasize the concept, the fossil record finding is qualitatively illustrated in fig. 8 using a population of 30 infected cells. at 3 time points following the initiation of art, we compare the net and current percentage of cells generated by viral replication. at day 60, 30% of cells remain that were originally generated by viral replication. this means 30% of observed sequences might produce a signal of evolution. however, at that time an overwhelming majority of new infected cells are being generated by proliferation.fig. 8qualitative illustration of the fossil record phenomenon. in an example population of 30 infected cells, the proportion of infected cells that were once generated by hiv replication (the net replication percentage, or fossil record of hiv replication) remains >30% for the first 2 months of art. however, in this time, the proportion of cells newly generated by hiv replication (current, shaded box) becomes negligible. the net fraction is observed experimentally, so our simulations indicate a contemporaneous representation of the hiv reservoir cannot be observed until the fossil record is completely washed out, sometime between 6 months and a year of artfull size imagediffering drivers of observed and current replicationwe next performed sensitivity analyses to identify parameters that impact the timing of transition from hiv replication to cellular proliferation as a source for current and observed infected cells. under all parameter assumptions, the majority of current infected cells arose from proliferation after a year of chronic art (fig. 9a). only the sanctuary decay rate (ζ) had an important impact on generation of current infected cells. when target cell availability did not decay at all, 25% of current infected cells were generated by hiv replication after a year of art (fig. 9a)—not consistent with lack of viral evolution observed at this time point. rapid disappearance of hiv replication as a source of current infected cells was identified regardless of initial reservoir volume, drug sanctuary volume, art efficacy, and reservoir composition (fraction of tem, tcm, and tn).fig. 9sensitivity analysis of model results. a–c see methods for complete simulated parameter ranges. a local sensitivity analysis (green: current; red: net, or observed) revealed no meaningful difference in percentage of new infected cells generated by viral replication after a year of art despite variability in initial reservoir volume i3(0), sanctuary fraction φs, and art effectiveness in and out of the sanctuary (\({\it{\epsilon }}_{\mathrm{s}}\) and \({\it{\epsilon }}\)). only an extremely low, or zero, sanctuary decay rate ζ predicted that a meaningful percentage (25%) of infected cells would be newly generated by hiv replication at one year, despite the fact that signals of evolution are not typically observed at this time point. including a high percentage of slowly proliferating naive cd4+ t cells (tn) in the reservoir alters the percentage of net, but not current, replication percentage. b 25 examples from 1000 global sensitivity analysis simulations. hiv replication accounted for fewer than 25% of current and net infected cells after a year of art in a majority of simulations. c the parameters most correlated with current and net replication percentage at 1 year of art are different. current replication percentage inversely correlates with sanctuary decay rate while net (observed) replication percentage positively correlates with reservoir composition (quantified with the fraction of naive latently infected cells). correlations are measured with the spearman correlation coefficientfull size imagethe net replication percentage was not affected by the decay rate of target cells within the drug sanctuary. only an increase in the percentage of slowly proliferating reservoir cells (tn) predicted an increase in the net replication percentage (fig. 9a). the drivers of current infected cell and net infected cell origin therefore differed completely, highlighting the major differences between observed sequence data and contemporaneous mechanisms generating new infected cells.to confirm these results, we simulated 104 patients in a global sensitivity analysis in which all parameter values were simultaneously varied. a rapid transition to proliferation as the source of new infected cells occurred during year one of art in a majority of simulated patients, and the same variables correlated significantly with net and current replication percentage, respectively (fig. 9b, c). overall, this analysis does not rule out the possibility of a drug sanctuary but confirms that its impact relative to cellular proliferation is likely to be minimal.discussion to eliminate hiv-infected cells during prolonged art, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which they persist. we use existing data and two methods—inference of hiv clone distributions and mechanistic mathematical modeling—to determine that a majority of infected cell persistence is due to cellular proliferation rather than hiv replication. strategies that enhance art delivery to anatomic drug sanctuaries are less likely to reduce infected cell burden relative to lymphocyte anti-proliferative therapies.while the raw data indicate substantial fractions of observed singleton sequences, when the total reservoir size is considered, these observed singletons are revealed to be members of clonal populations. the hiv reservoir appears to be defined by a rank-abundance distribution of clone sizes that can be roughly approximated as a power-law relationship. this distribution implies that a small number of massive clones and a massive number of small clones together-comprise a large percentage of sequences.a power-law distribution can be created when a heterogeneous population grows multiplicatively with a widely variable growth rate55, which suggests that the distribution of clone sizes in the reservoir has a mechanistic basis. it is plausible, though unproven, that variable growth arises from rapid bursts of cd4+ t cell proliferation due to cognate antigen recognition. hiv integration into tumor suppression genes could also account for clonal dominance36,37. smaller clones may arise from homeostatic proliferation, or less frequent exposure to cognate antigen.while we cannot rule out cellular longevity as a cause of hiv persistence in certain cells, the observation of multiple clonal sequences cannot arise purely from long-lived latently infected cells. our analysis suggests that most observed singleton sequences arise from populations that have undergone many rounds of clonal proliferation.we developed a mathematical model because our inference techniques do not capture time-dynamics of the reservoir or reconcile observations from early and late art. this model is the first to include the three main mechanistic hypotheses for reservoir persistence: an art sanctuary, long-lived latent cells, and latent cell proliferation. the model recapitulates known hiv rna decay kinetics while tracking cells that originate from ongoing replication and cellular proliferation.we demonstrate why a fossil record of evolution is observed early during art, whether or not a small drug sanctuary exists. the model differentiates the fraction of infected cells contemporaneously generated by hiv replication (current replication percentage) from the fraction that were generated by viral replication in the past (net, or observed, replication percentage). the observed replication percentage remains non-negligible in the first months of art while the current replication percentage drops rapidly. an observed sequence that gives a signal of divergence from the founder virus likely represents a historic rather than a current replication event. because time of detection does not correlate linearly with sequence age, inference of evolution early during art is problematic20,21. however, the fossil record is transient: within a year of effective art, observed phylogenetic data represents true reservoir dynamics. our model agrees with observations reflecting a lack of contemporaneous hiv evolution after this time14,22,23,24,25,26,27,29,30,36,37.our sensitivity analysis shows that the variable correlating with higher observed replication percentages (larger proportion of slowly proliferating cd4+ t cells in the reservoir) differs from the variable correlating with higher current replication percentages (slower decrease in sanctuary size). yet, only current replication percentage represents the true amount of ongoing hiv evolution. without requiring any phylogenetic simulation, this simple model provides an explanation for observed pseudo-evolution during the first months of art and none thereafter14,22,23,24,25,26,27,29,30,36,37. if we assume a large drug sanctuary that does not contract with time, a persistent low-level sanctuary would emerge that stabilizes at 6 months and generates ongoing evolution at later art time points. notably, this has not been observed in clinical studies.our modeling results inform experiments in two ways. first, using rarefaction, we suggest sample sizes to verify our hypotheses experimentally (supplementary fig. 4). observed values of sequence richness and clone size, are substantial underestimates. current studies only sample the tip of the iceberg of the hiv reservoir. hundreds of thousands of infected cells from a single time point would be required to capture true reservoir diversity. this sampling depth could only be feasibly achieved as part of an autopsy study. second, we demonstrate that the wash-out period for the fossil record may be up to a year post art. future reservoir studies should be conducted after this time point to avoid observation of historic rather than contemporaneous evolution.our study has important caveats. current integration site data, while robust, is limited to a handful of participants in only a few studies. modeling rank-abundance curves makes a large assumption about the continuity of the data. the power-law model represents but one approach. future work should address why that distribution provides good fit to the data. extrapolating abundance curves has been criticized: our attempt to design a simple parametric model was based on the additional information of reservoir size and our goal to define an upper limit on reservoir richness56; nevertheless, the tail of our distributions is impossible to precisely characterize with our methods.our approach is calibrated against sequence data from blood. however, the dynamics of hiv within lymph tissue may have different distributions. while historically, blood samples have been taken as a surrogate for hiv-infected cells, we cannot rule out a small drug sanctuary that does not exchange virus or infected cells with blood. it seems unlikely that such a sanctuary could be sustained because some trafficking of cd4+ t cells from other compartments may be necessary to avoid terminal target cell limitation.in conclusion , we demonstrate that the majority of hiv-infected cells arise from proliferation during art and provide an explanation for incongruent observations of evolution before and after a year of art. because proliferation is the dominant force sustaining the hiv reservoir34, we suggest limiting proliferation as a prime therapeutic target10,11,57.methodsrank-abundance of hiv integration siteswe used an ecological framework to study the abundance of clonal hiv. to do so, we applied methods to integration site and replication-competent hiv sequence data. unique sequences or integration define distinct clonal populations. the population size of that clone defines its abundance. by ranking the clones from largest to smallest by abundance, we developed a rank-abundance curve, a(r), for each participant time point. no assumptions were made about the stability or dynamics of the reservoir rank-abundance over time.in our analysis of data from wagner et al.37, we combine measurements taken closely in time and use the median time point as in the original publication. in our analysis of maldarelli et al.36, we used unedited published integration site counts. it is important to note that the methods used by wagner et al. and maldarelli et al. are slightly different. the isla method used by wagner et al. is lower throughput than the next generation shotgun sequencing method used by maldarelli et al. the absolute number of viruses identified by each group therefore differs. however, the fraction of observed singletons is similar between the two studies. we manually counted the abundance of replication-competent hiv sequences from phylogenetic trees in hosmane et al.34.calculation of rarefaction curveswe used rarefaction curves to estimate the expected number of distinct sequences that would still be present in a subsample of k sequences from the observed data with sample size of n:$$\left\langle {n_k} \right\rangle = r^{{\mathrm{obs}}} - \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} n \\ k \end{array}} \right)^{ - 1}\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_{r = 1}^{r^{{\mathrm{obs}}}} \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {n - a(r)} \\ k \end{array}} \right),$$
                            (1)
                        where the parentheses indicate binomial coefficients, e.g., \(({{n}\atop {k}}) = \frac{{n!}}{{k!\left( {n - k} \right)!}}\). later, we extrapolated rarefaction curves using the modeled distributions for the total reservoir size l. because the number of samples we allowed was orders of magnitude smaller than the number of cells in the reservoir, k ≪ l, we used stirling’s approximation to simplify the binomial coefficients. the expected number of sequences after k samples is then$$\left\langle {\tilde n_k} \right\rangle = r - \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_{r = 1}^r \left[ {1 - \frac{{a(r)}}{l}} \right]^k,$$

                        an expression which avoids computation of large factorials (derivation in the supplementary methods).nonparametric estimation of species richnesswe employed the chao1 estimator to set a lower bound on the sequence or integration site richness58. a derivation of the estimator is included in the supplementary methods. chao1 is not a mechanistic model and requires no free parameters. inference relies on only the number of observed singleton (n1) and observed doubleton (n2) sequences such that$$r^{{\mathrm{chao1}}} = r^{{\mathrm{obs}}} + \frac{{n_1(n_1 - 1)}}{{2(n_2 + 1)}}.$$
                            (3)
                        we display an asymmetric confidence interval in fig. 3 (see chao et al.58 or supplementary methods for the definition). we also note it is possible the data are undersampled to the extent that a one-sided confidence interval may be more appropriate. thus, for our biological conclusion s we take the chao1 point estimate as a lower bound, and constrain the upper bound using the parametric model (eq. 4). other richness estimators (jackknife 1 and 2) were tested but provided similar and consistently lower estimates of richness than the chao1 estimator. these were not included in our results because the chao1 was interpreted as a lower bound on true sequence richness.parametric models of rank-abundanceestimates of the size of the hiv reservoir (both replication-competent and total) were gathered from the published literature33. we then developed a parametric model to quantify the true rank-abundance distribution of the complete hiv reservoir. examination of the data indicated a possible log-log-linear relationship, so we chose a discrete integer power-law model so that the probability of a rank is described by p(r) = ψ(r)r−α where the coefficient \(\psi \left( r \right) = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{r = 1}^r {r^{ - \alpha }}\) is the normalization constant for the power-law. then, to describe the true rank-abundance a(r) we chose the reservoir size depending on the model context (replication-competent l = 107 or total hiv dna l = 109). to ensure integer number of cells, we rounded this distribution, and forced the total number of cells to equate with reservoir size. that is,$$a\left( {r;\alpha ,r,l} \right) = \left| {\left[ {l\psi (r)r^{ - \alpha }} \right]} \right|$$
                            (4)
                        where |[]| indicates rounding to the nearest integer. thus, our model depended on two free parameters, a power-law exponent α, and the reservoir richness r. other functional forms were explored but simplicity and accurate reproduction of the data were optimal with the power-law.fitting rank-abundance modelsusing the experimental data we found the best-fit model using the following procedure. we fixed the reservoir size l depending on the model context (replication-competent or total hiv dna). we chose a value for r and α from ranges r ∈ [103,107] and α ∈ [0,2] to specify the model. then, we sampled the extrapolated distribution 10 times using multinomial sampling with the same number of samples as the experimental data being fit, \({\cal m}(n,p(r))\). this procedure assumes that sampling cells does not change the distribution of the reservoir, which is reasonable given the reservoir size. each sampled data set was compared to the experimental data by computing the residual sum of squares (rss) error of the cumulative proportional abundance (cpa) curves. for each model then, the reported error is the average rss over the 10 resamplings. because the rss error is not symmetric across the domain of the cpa, this approach becomes similar to minimizing the kolmogorov–smirnov (ks) statistic: the maximum deviation between two cumulative distributions. for each experimental data set 2500 model parameter sets were generated, and fitting results were visualized as heat maps (see figs. 4a and 5a for example). because the procedure becomes computationally expensive as r > 107, we did not explore values above this threshold. in theory, it is possible to have a distribution with all clones having a single member r = l, α = 0. for the total dna reservoir, this value would result in r = 109. however, this model was never optimal. in fact, as richness increased beyond ≈106, the model was no longer sensitive to r. thus, it appeared that finding the best-fit α was sufficient to specify the model if proper bounds on richness were included.we excluded models where r < rchao1, but we also sought to identify an upper bound for r. indeed, certain model parameter combinations are mathematically impossible. for example, for a given power-law exponent, the richness is constrained below a certain value for a given reservoir size. similar arguments have been made in ecology under the terminology of feasible sets59. to determine the largest possible richness that still optimized fit, we chose the roughly constant value of α that emerged when r was large enough to be unidentifiable. then, we noted that for large r it is reasonable to allow \(\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{r = 1}^r a (r) = {\int}_1^r a (r){\mathrm{d}}r\). r is thus approximately bounded, and we solved for the maximal value or the upper bound on the richness given the best-fit α and the chosen l. a discussion  and numerical validation of this approximation is presented in the supplementary methods and supplementary fig. 2. choosing the model with largest richness provides the sequence abundance most permissive of true singleton sequences—the model most favoring ongoing replication as an explanation for hiv persistence. in extrapolated reservoirs, we used the maximum richness model to ensure we were biasing the results as strongly as possible against our own hypothesis.model fitting validation with simulated dataa discussion  and demonstration of model validation is included in the supplementary methods and supplementary fig. 1. the exercise shows that simply fitting a power-law to the experimental data (using log-log-linear regression) without the extra sampling step necessarily underestimates the power-law exponent, demonstrating the utility of our approach. moreover, it shows that a published maximum likelihood approach60 is not as accurate for these data as our resampling approach (code hosted at http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ last accessed july 2018). we simulated a reservoir with known power-law exponent supplementary fig. 1a and tested for recovery of this known value. the fitting validation proceeded identically to the data fitting: 2500 distributions were generated (225 examples are shown in supplementary fig. 1d), the simulated data was sampled supplementary fig. 1b, and reranked supplementary fig. 1c. fitting results supplementary fig. 1e, f are shown analogous to figs. 4 & 5a, b. model comparison demonstrating optimal accuracy with our resampling approach is shown in supplementary fig. 1g.mechanistic model for the persistence of the hiv reservoirthe canonical model for hiv dynamics describes the time-evolution of the concentrations of susceptible s and infected i cd4+ t cells and hiv virus v50,54,61. our model grows from the canonical model, simplifying with several approximations and extending the biological detail to simulate hiv dynamics on art, including a long-lived latent reservoir and a potential drug sanctuary. perelson et al. first noticed and quantified a biphasic clearance of hiv virus upon initiation of art and showed that viral half-lives of 1.5 and 14 days correspond with the half-lives of two infected cell compartments50,54. with longer observation times and single-copy viral assays, palmer et al.51 documented four-phases of viral clearance after initiation of art. because of uncertainty in distinguishing the third and fourth phase in that study, we focus on the first three decay rates and corresponding cellular compartments, attributing a mixture of the third and fourth phase decay to the clearance of the productively infectious latent reservoir (half-life 44 months) as measured by siliciano et al.3 and corroborated by crooks et al.2 and the clearance of hiv dna47. we developed a mechanistic mathematical model that has three types of infected cells i1, i2, i3 that are meant to simulate productively infected cells, pre-integration infected cells, and latently infected cells, respectively. we classify rapid death δ1 and viral production within actively infected cells i1. cells with longer half-life that may represent pre-integration infected cells i2 are activated to i1 at rate ξ2. i2 may represent cd4+ t cells with a prolonged pre-integration phase, but their precise biology does not affect model outcomes48.the state i3(j) represents latently infected reservoir cells of phenotype j, which contain a single chromosomally integrated hiv dna provirus44. i3 reactivates to i1 at rate ξ3 which at present is assumed to be constant across cell phenotypes49. the probabilities of a newly infected cell entering i1, i2, i3(j), are τ1, τ2, τ3(j). because we are focused on the role of proliferation, we assume sub-populations of i312, including effector memory (tem), central memory (tcm), and naive (tn) cd4+ t cells, which proliferate and die at different rates α3(j), δ3(j)12,42,43. parameter values and initial conditions for the model are collected in table 1.modeling with an art sanctuarya recent hypothesis about reservoir persistence suggests there may be a small, anatomic sanctuary (1 in 105 infected cells) in which art is not therapeutic4. thus, we included the state variable is that is maintained at a constant set-point level prior to art, where all new infected cells arise from ongoing replication. the amount of virus produced by the sanctuary vs is extremely low relative to non-sanctuary regions because art results in levels undetectable by sensitive assays51.many studies have demonstrated that hiv accelerates immunosenescene through abnormal activation of cd4+ t cells62,63,64. art results in a marked reduction of t cell activation and apoptosis, a potential signature of hiv susceptible cells65. by examining the decline of activation markers for cd4+ t cells, we approximated the decay kinetics of activated t cells upon art, inferring approximate decay kinetics of the target cells in our model52,53,66. a range of initial values exists (from ~5 to 20% activation) depending on stage of hiv infection, yet after a year of art, a large percentage of patients return to almost normal, or slightly elevated cd4+ t cell activation levels (2–3%)52. because we assume that target cell depletion is minimal at viral load set-point, we allow susceptible cell concentrations to decrease over time as immune activation decreases. we choose an exponential model, i.e., s = s(0)e−ζt, which is an obvious simplification (it could also be biphasic but the data are not granular enough to discriminate this dynamic subtlety). from existing data, the decay constant should be in the range ζ ~ [0.002, 0.01] day–1 52,66. we extend this decay into the sanctuary, allowing the number of susceptible cells over the whole body to decrease so that is = i1(0)φse−ζt where φs is the fraction of infected cells in a sanctuary. model simulations are also performed without this assumption of target cell contraction.last, we use the quasi-static approximation that virus is proportional to the number of actively infected cells in all compartments v = n(i1 + is) where n = π/γ, the ratio of the viral production rate to the viral clearance rate (table 1). the model is thus$$\begin{array}{l}\dot i_1 = \tau _1{{\beta }}_{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} - \delta _1i_1 + \xi _2i_2 + \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_j \xi _3i_{3(j)}\\ \dot i_2 = \tau _2{{\beta }}_{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} + \left( {\alpha _2 - \delta _2 - \xi _2} \right)i_2\\ \dot i_{3(j)} = \tau _{3(j)}{{\beta }}_{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} + \left( {\alpha _{3(j)} - \delta _{3(j)} - \xi _3} \right)i_{3(j)},\end{array}$$
                            (5)
                        where the over-dot denotes derivative in time.comparing proliferation to viral replicationby solving the ode model (eq. 5), we computed the total number of newly infected cells generated in a given time interval δt by ongoing replication. that value is \(i^{{\mathrm{rep}}}(t) = \left( {\beta _{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} + \phi _{\mathrm{s}}\beta {{sv}}_{\mathrm{s}}} \right){\mathrm{\delta }}t\). the total number of newly infected cells generated by proliferation of a previously infected cell can be computed similarly in a time interval as \(i^{{\mathrm{pro}}}(t) = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{i(j)} {\alpha _{i(j)}i_{i(j)}{\mathrm{\delta }}t}\). therefore, the percentage of infected cells generated by current replication is written$${\mathrm{\phi }}^{{\mathrm{current}}}\left( t \right) = 100 \cdot \frac{{i^{{\mathrm{rep}}}(t)}}{{i^{{\mathrm{rep}}}(t) + i^{{\mathrm{pro}}}(t)}}.$$
                            (6)
                        we can further subset this current replication fraction by examining the percentage of infected cells that enter the long-lived latent state i3 by defining \(i^{{\mathrm{rep}}(3)}(t) = \tau _3(\beta _{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} + \phi _{\mathrm{s}}\beta {{sv}}_{\mathrm{s}}){\mathrm{\delta }}t\) and \(i^{{\mathrm{pro}}(3)}(t) = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_j {\alpha _{3(j)}i_{3(j)}{\mathrm{\delta }}t}\) so that$${\mathrm{\phi }}^{{\mathrm{current}}(3)}\left( t \right) = 100 \cdot \frac{{i^{{\mathrm{rep}}(3)}(t)}}{{i^{{\mathrm{rep}}(3)}(t) + i^{{\mathrm{pro}}(3)}(t)}}.$$
                            (7)
                        the net (or observed) replication percentage, is the fraction of cells that were once generated by viral replication. to compute this quantity, we use an additional set of odes that we refer to as tracking equations because they do not change the dynamics of the system, and only are used to track specific variables. to denote the net value as opposed to current value we use a superscript σ. the net cells generated by viral replication in state i of phenotype j is governed by the differential equation$$\dot i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{rep}}} = \tau _{i(j)}{{\beta }}_{\it{\epsilon }}{{sv}} - \left( {\delta _{i(j)} - \xi _{i(j)}} \right)i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{rep}}}.$$
                            (8)
                        likewise, the net cells generated by proliferation in state i of phenotype j is governed by the differential equation$$\dot i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{pro}}} = \alpha _{i(j)}i_{i(j)} - \left( {\delta _{i(j)} - \xi _{i(j)}} \right)i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{pro}}}.$$
                            (9)
                        we note that because we only allow these two mechanisms, \(\dot i_{i(j)} = \dot i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{rep}}} + \dot i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{pro}}}\) and \(i_{i\left( j \right)}(t) = i_{i\left( j \right)}^{\left( {\mathrm{\sigma }} \right){\mathrm{rep}}}(t) + i_{i\left( j \right)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{pro}}}\). we solved the tracking equations separately and took the sum over cell types and phenotypes. ultimately, the net replication fraction is$${\mathrm{\phi }}^{\mathrm{\sigma }}\left( t \right) = 100 \cdot \frac{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_{i(j)} i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{rep}}}(t)}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_{i(j)} i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{rep}}}(t) + i_{i(j)}^{({\mathrm{\sigma }}){\mathrm{pro}}}(t)}}.$$
                            (10)
                        in all simulations, we assumed that 100% of infected cells at the initiation of art were generated by viral replication, that is φς(0) = 100. this assumption biases results in favor of replication. however, we choose it because, to the best of our knowledge, studies of proliferation during chronic untreated hiv have not been performed.sensitivity analysisusing estimated parameter bounds [lower, upper], we completed a local and global sensitivity analysis. these ranges were chosen to cover a wide range of possible assumptions. we allowed i3(0) = [0.02,2] cells µl−1, φs = [10−6,10−4] unitless, ζ = [0,0.2] day−1, \({\it{\epsilon }} = [0.9,0.99]\) unitless, \({\it{\epsilon }}_{\mathrm{s}} = [0,0.9]\) unitless, i3(n)(0) = [0,0.5] × i3(0) cells µl−1. for the local analysis, we used all values as in table 1 and modified one parameter at a time over each listed range above. the global analysis was performed in python by using 104 latin hypercube samplings of the complete 6-dimensional parameter space using pydoe67. the key outcome, the replication percentage (net and current) at 1 year of art, was correlated to each parameter using the spearman correlation coefficient—defined by the ratio of the covariance between the outcome and the variable divided by the standard deviations of each when the variables were rank-ordered by value.code availabilitycomputational code for all calculations and simulations was performed in python and matlab. and is freely available at https://github.com/dbrvs/reservoir_persistence.

Methamphetamine functions as a novel CD4+ T-cell activator via the sigma-1 receptor to enhance HIV-1 infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35757-x,Research,30 January 2019,yes,"methamphetamine (meth) exacerbates hiv-1 pathobiology by increasing virus transmission and replication and accelerating clinical progression to aids. meth has been shown to alter the expression of hiv-1 co-receptors and impair intrinsic resistance mechanisms of immune cells. however, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in augmenting hiv-1 replication in t-cells are still not yet clear. here, we demonstrate that pretreatment with meth of cd4+ t-cells enhanced hiv-1 replication. we observed upregulation of cd4+ t-cell activation markers and enhanced expression of mir-34c-5p and mir-155 in these cells. further, we noted activation of the sigma-1 receptor and enhanced intracellular ca2+ concentration and camp release in cd4+ t-cells upon meth treatment, which resulted in increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors nfκb, creb, and nfat1. increased gene expression of il-4 and il-10 was also observed in meth treated cd4+ t-cells. moreover, proteasomal degradation of ago1 occurred upon meth treatment, further substantiating the drug as an activator of t-cells. taken together, these findings show a previously unreported mechanism whereby meth functions as a novel t-cell activator via the sigma-1 signaling pathway, enhancing replication of hiv-1 with expression of mir-34c-5p, and transcriptional activation of nfκb, creb and nfat1.
introduction methamphetamine (meth) abuse poses a daunting challenge in the prevention and treatment of hiv-1 infection1. worldwide, meth is the second most frequently used illicit drug2; its recreational popularity is one of the fastest-growing problems in the united states, as it enhances high-risk sexual behaviors and increases hiv-1 transmission3,4,5. meth may also contribute to increased viral replication, accelerated progression to aids, poor adherence to anti-hiv-therapy and acquiring resistance to antiviral agents6,7,8,9. however, the exact molecular mechanisms of how meth may enhance hiv-1 pathobiology and disease progression are yet to be fully elucidated.studies in animal models have shown that meth treatment can increase viral load in hiv-1 infected animals10,11. in particular, marcondes et al. reported that chronic meth treatment raised viral load in the brains of simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) infected rhesus macaques, and resulted in activation of natural killer cells10. clinical studies have shown that meth can increase viral load in infected individuals, and its use also correlates with decreased efficacy of antiretroviral drugs6,7,10,11. in vitro, it has been demonstrated that meth promotes hiv-1 replication in hiv-1 infected cd4+ t-cells and monocytes11. further, meth has been shown to enhance hiv-1 infection in dendritic cells (dcs) and macrophages by regulating the expression of hiv-1 co-receptors and dc-sign12,13. in microglial cells, meth enhanced hiv-1 transcription via nfκb/sp1 dependent activation of hiv-1 ltr14. conversely, mantri et al. demonstrated inhibition of hiv-1 replication in the presence of meth in human cd4+ t-cells and claimed that meth modulates anti-hiv-1 mirna expression in these cells15. some recent reports have also indicated a role for meth in inducing t-cell dysfunction and altering cell cycle progression, which can modulate the outcome of viral diseases16,17. thus, although many studies have indicated a role for meth in exacerbation of hiv-1 infection, the full range of effects of meth on hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells is still not yet clear.in the brain, meth has been shown to activate the dopamine and sigma-1 receptors (σ1-r)18,19. moreover, meth increased the expression of the σ1-r in astrocytes by activating src, erk mitogen-activated protein kinase, nfκb and cyclic-amp response element-binding protein (creb) pathways19. in addition, meth can activate g-protein coupled receptors such as trace amine associated receptor 1 (taar1), and increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) levels20. activation of these signaling pathways has been implicated in meth mediated neuroinflammation21.meth also has been shown to modulate intracellular restriction factors by regulating mirna expression, thereby enhancing hiv-1 infection22. studies indicate an extensive alteration in mirna expression in the brain of meth-sensitized mice with post-translational regulation of gene expression23. in humans, mirnas can be transcribed to primary mirna by rna polymerase ii24. these primary mirnas are further cleaved by rnase iii enzyme, drosha, and its cofactor to generate short, stem-loop structured pre-mirnas that are then exported to the cytoplasm where they are further processed to mature mirna by dicer125,26,27. the mature mirnas bind to a member of the argonaute (ago) family within a multicomponent complex known as risc (rna induced silencing complex), which functions either by mirna-dependent mrna decay or suppression of translation processes25,26,27. a significant downregulation of ago2 was observed in the nucleus accumbens of meth sensitized mice and expression of precursor mirna was unaltered in these tissues, indicating that meth may inhibit the ago protein mediated splicing of precursor mirna and its maturation23.here, we aimed to identify mechanisms that govern meth enhanced hiv-1 infection of cd4+ t-cells. specifically, we focused on pathways that have been found to be altered in other cell types concurrent with meth exposure. we found that the sigma-1 receptor mediates meth activation of transcription factors nfκb, creb and nfat1, known to facilitate replication of hiv-1. further, we demonstrate that meth treatment enhances hiv-1 replication in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells by inducing an activated phenotype via the sigma-1 receptor, characterized by cell surface markers and increased expression of mir-34c-5p and mir-155, which have also been shown to regulate hiv-1 infection. this occurred in conjunction with proteasomal degradation of ago1, resulting in the loss of structural integrity of p-bodies. these studies reveal several novel mechanisms whereby meth acts to impair immune defenses and augment hiv-1 infection in cd4+ t-cells.resultsmeth pretreatment enhanced hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cellsprevious studies in in vitro models have demonstrated that meth enhances hiv-1 replication in t-cells, dcs, macrophages and neural progenitor cells11,12,13,14. the significance of these results is supported by an epidemiological study, which demonstrated increased viral loads in meth using hiv-1 infected individuals compared with non-users who were infected28. however, the effects of meth on hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells are controversial, as mantri et al. reported inhibition of hiv-1 replication in meth treated cd4+ t-cells15. here, we first examined hiv-1 bal replication in pha/il-2 stimulated cd4+ t-cells (hereafter referred to as cd4+ t-cells) after either pretreating cells with 50 µm or 100 µm meth for 24 hours and then infecting cells with hiv-1, or treating the cells with hiv-1 and meth simultaneously. we analyzed hiv-1 p24 titer at different time points in the cell supernatants and observed significant increases in hiv-1 p24 titer in cells pretreated with 50 µm or 100 µm of meth on days 1, 2 and 3 (fig. 1a). we confirmed these results by estimating the intracellular hiv-1 p24 by flow cytometry, which showed a significant increase in hiv-1 p24 in cells pretreated with meth compared to control cells (fig. 1b). it has been shown that naïve cd4+ t-cells or resting t-cells are refractory to hiv-1 infection29. notably, unstimulated cd4+ t-cells (without pha/il-2) exhibited a naïve phenotype, characterized by low expression of cd4+ t-cell activation markers cd69 and cd25, as well as higher expression of naïve cd4+ t-cell marker cd45ra30. thus we next analyzed the effects of meth pretreatment on hiv-1 replication in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells; we observed enhanced hiv-1 replication in these cells compared to untreated cells (fig. 1c). intriguingly, we did not observe any significant change in the hiv-1 p24 titer when cd4+ t-cells were treated with meth and hiv-1 simultaneously (fig. 1d). these results indicate that meth may alter cellular conditions favorable for hiv-1 infection in both stimulated and unstimulated cd4+ t-cells.figure 1meth pretreatment enhances hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells. (a) pha/il-2 stimulated cd4+ t-cells were pretreated with or without meth (50 or 100 µm) for 24 hours followed by incubation with hiv-1 bal. supernatants were harvested on days 0–3 and analyzed for extracellular hiv-1 p24 concentrations by elisa (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01). (b) cd4+ t-cells treated and infected in (a) were fixed, permeabilized, stained with fitc-conjugated p24 antibody, and intracellular p24 levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. fold change was calculated by considering untreated cells as 1(*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01). (c) unstimulated cd4+ t-cells (without pha/il-2) were pretreated with or without meth (100 µm) for 24 hours followed by incubation with hiv-1 bal. supernatants were harvested on days 0–3 and analyzed for extracellular hiv-1 p24 concentrations by elisa (*p ≤ 0.05). (d) stimulated cd4+ t-cells were treated with or without meth (50 or 100 µm) and incubated with hiv-1 bal simultaneously. supernatants were harvested on days 0–3 and analyzed for extracellular hiv-1 p24 concentrations by elisa. data represent the mean ± sem of 3 experiments done in triplicate for untreated cells vs. cells treated with meth.full size imagemeth enhanced intracellular calcium and camp levels in cd4+ t-cellsmeth has been shown to induce increased intracellular calcium concentration [ca2+] in neuronal cells30. to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in meth mediated effects on cd4+ t-cells, we analyzed the release of second messengers ca2+ and camp after treating the cells with the drug. we observed significant increases in intracellular calcium levels upon meth treatment; the maximum concentration was observed at 1 minute. this result suggests that meth may have released the calcium from intracellular stores (fig. 2a,b). in addition, meth has been shown to modulate cytokine secretion by regulating a camp/pka/creb signaling pathway in microglial cells31. we observed significant increases in camp at 30 minutes after meth treatment indicating that meth can activate camp mediated signaling pathways in cd4+ t-cells (fig. 2c). notably, pathways involving camp and transcription factors such as creb have been associated with t-cell activation32. western blot analysis also revealed increased phosphorylation of akt, src and erk1/2 upon meth treatment in these cells (fig. 2d).figure 2meth enhances intracellular calcium and camp levels in cd4+ t-cells. (a) calcium influx was measured by staining the cd4+ t-cells with fluo-4,am, followed by addition of 100 µm meth and live cell imaging by confocal microscopy. (b) pixel densities of images in (a) were determined by imagej and plotted against time (seconds). data represent the mean ± sem of 3 independent experiments for untreated cells vs. cells treated with meth. (c) camp levels were analyzed by elisa after treating cd4+ t-cells with 100 µm meth and acquiring samples at different time points (0, 15 min, 30 min and 1 hour). data represent the mean ± sd of 3 independent experiments (*p ≤ 0.05, ***p ≤ 0.001). (d) cd4+ t-cells were untreated or treated with 100 µm meth for the indicated time points (0.5–24 hours), lysed, and protein extracts were analyzed by western blotting for the signaling molecules p-akt, p-src and p-erk. gapdh was used as a loading control. full-length blots are presented in supplementary fig. s1.full size imagemeth induces increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of creb, nfat1 and nfκb in cd4+ t-cellswe next analyzed the effects of meth on the downstream cellular transcription factors, creb, nuclear factor of activated t-cells (nfat1), and nfκb, which are associated with t-cell immune activation32. we first examined the phosphorylation status and levels of expression of these molecules after treating cd4+ t-cells with meth at various time points. our analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of creb and the p65 subunit of nfκb. however, total expression of these molecules was unaltered (fig. 3a). next, we analyzed the effects of meth on their expression in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. we observed increased nuclear translocation of p-nfκb, p-creb and nfat1 in meth treated cells compared to untreated cells, with levels of p-nfκb and nfat1 significantly reduced in the cytoplasmic fractions (fig. 3b). we performed confocal microscopy to confirm these results and observed increased nuclear translocation of p-nfκb, p-creb and nfat1 in meth treated cells compared to control cells (fig. 3c). these results indicate that meth induced translocation of p-nfκb, p-creb and nfat1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cd4+ t-cells.figure 3meth induced increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of creb, nfat1 and nfκb in cd4+ t-cells. (a) cd4+ t-cells were untreated or treated with 100 µm meth for different time points (0.5–24 hours), lysed and the protein extracts were analyzed for the activation of transcription factors nfκb and creb and nfat1 by western blotting. gapdh was used as a loading control. full-length blots are presented in supplementary fig. s2.

(c) confocal images of nfκb (upper panel), creb (middle panel) or nfat1 (lower panel) staining in cd4+ t-cells untreated or treated with 100 µm meth for 1 hour. meth treated samples show nuclear translocation of nfκb, creb and nfat1. scale bar = 10 µm. (d) cd4+ t-cells were untreated or treated with 100 µm meth for 24 hours, rna was isolated, and il-4 and il-10 gene expression was analyzed by qrt-pcr. fold change was calculated by normalizing the meth treated cells to untreated cells. data represent the mean ± sd of 3 independent experiments (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01).full size imagenfat1 has been shown to regulate the expression of cytokines il-4 and il-10 during t-cell activation33,34. qrt-pcr analysis revealed increased levels of mrna of both il-4 and il-10 in meth treated cells compared to control cells, suggesting that meth induced translocation of nfat1 may participate in the increased transcription of il-4 and il-10 in cd4+ t-cells (fig. 3d).meth mediated its effect through activating the sigma-1 receptor in cd4+ t-cellsmeth has been shown to exert its effects by activating dopamine receptors and/or sigma-1 receptors in the brain18,19. hence, we analyzed effects of meth on these receptors in cd4+ t-cells. all four dopamine receptors (d1dr, d2dr, d3dr, and d4dr) and the sigma-1 receptor were expressed constitutively, and we observed significant increased expression only of the sigma-1 receptor after meth treatment (fig. 4a). these observations indicated that meth may act via the sigma-1 receptor in cd4+ t-cells (fig. 4a,b). to confirm its functional role, we treated the cells with sigma-1 receptor specific inhibitor (dihydrobromide, bd1047), then with meth, and analyzed the activation of downstream signaling molecules by western blot analysis. the sigma-1 receptor inhibitor significantly blocked the phosphorylation of nfκb, erk and src kinases (fig. 4c). these results indicate that meth induces the activation of transcription factors in cd4+ t-cells by activating the sigma-1 receptor. next, to confirm the role of sigma-1 receptor in meth mediated enhanced hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells, we employed the sigma-1 receptor inhibitor in both unstimulated and stimulated cells. we found that this inhibitor significantly abrogated meth mediated enhanced hiv-1 replication in both the stimulated and unstimulated cell types (fig. 4d). these results confirm that sigma-1 receptor signaling is needed for meth mediated enhanced hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells.figure 4effects of meth on dopamine receptors and sigma-1 receptor in cd4+ t-cells.

(c) expression analyses of mirs-34c-5p and 155 by qrt-pcr in untreated and meth treated unstimulated cd4+ t-cells in the presence or absence of sigma-1 receptor inhibitor (σ1 r inh.) at day 3 (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001).full size imagenext, to analyze the effects of meth mediated activation of signaling molecules and alteration of mirna expression on t-cell activation, we tested the expression levels of cd4+ t-cell activation markers by flow cytometry after treating unstimulated cd4+ t-cells with meth at different time points. drug treatment modestly increased cd45ro expression (1.3 fold) and hla-dr (1.5 fold). intriguingly, we observed significant increases in the expression of other cd4+ t-cell activation markers such as cd69 (>4.5 fold) and cd25 (>2.5 fold). naïve t-cells have a cd45ra+ phenotype, which we found to be decreased in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells by 40% on day 3 of meth treatment (fig. 6a). thus, taken together, meth treatment can elevate the expression of mirs-34c-5p and 155 which have been shown to increase cd4+ t-cell activation, and may make the cells more susceptible to hiv-1 infection. we then analyzed the role of meth mediated activation of the sigma-1 receptor in enhanced expression of t-cell activation markers in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells using sigma-1 receptor inhibitor. we observed that drug mediated increased expression of cd69 and hla-dr was significantly abrogated in the presence of the sigma-1 receptor inhibitor (fig. 6b). these studies further indicate that meth induces a novel pathway of cd4+ t-cell activation by triggering sigma-1 receptor signaling.figure 6meth induced the expression of activation markers in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells: (a) unstimulated cd4+ t-cells were treated with or without meth (100 µm) for 3 days, cells were harvested on days 0, 1 and 3 (d0, d1 and d3), stained for the indicated t-cell activation markers, fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. bar diagrams showing the fold change in the expression of indicated activation markers in meth treated unstimulated cd4+ t-cells. fold change was calculated by normalizing the meth treated cells to untreated cells (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001).

independent experiments.full size imageprocessing bodies (p-bodies) are important, discrete foci in the cytoplasm that play a key role in mrna gene silencing and regulation of mrna turnover38,39. ago proteins and gw182 are the main components of p-bodies38,39,40. since we observed decreased expression of ago1 in meth treated cd4+ t-cells, we next analyzed the structural integrity of p-bodies in meth treated cd4+ t-cells. confocal microscopic analysis and immunoprecipitation analysis showed decreased co-localization of ago1 and gw182 in meth treated cells compared to control cells (fig. 7c,d). these results indicate that meth may alter the structural integrity of p-bodies in cd4+ t-cells.discussion meth use is associated with a high risk of contracting hiv-1 infection, and its transmission1,2,3,4,5. moreover, meth enhances the viral load in hiv-1 positive, active drug using individuals by increasing viral replication in t-cells, monocytes and neural progenitor cells7,11. however, the molecular mechanisms involved in these meth mediated effects in the immunopathogenesis of hiv-1 still are not fully elucidated. here, we characterized novel molecular effects of meth on cd4+ t-cells and their implications in hiv-1 replication.our experiments reveal that pretreatment of cd4+ t-cells with meth significantly enhanced hiv-1 replication; however, there was no significant change in replication when cells were treated with hiv-1 and meth simultaneously. a previous study by skowronska demonstrated enhanced hiv-1 replication in neural progenitor cells when they were pretreated with meth but not when they are exposed to hiv-1 and meth together14. to address the mechanism of this effect, they point to meth mediated nfκb/sp1 dependent activation of the hiv-1 ltr14. intriguingly, our experiments with unstimulated cd4+ t-cells also showed that meth pretreatment enhanced hiv-1 replication. in vitro, single cell cultures of resting or naïve cd4+ t-cells are resistant to hiv-1 infection41,42. however, in vivo the tissue microenvironment facilitates the activation of naïve t-cells and provides conditions favorable for productive hiv-1 infection41,42,43. hence, cd4+ t-cell activation is considered to be a key factor that facilitates infection44,45. moreover, expression of the t-cell activation markers cd25 and hla-dr has been shown to correlate with enhanced hiv-1 infection43. when we analyzed cell activation markers in unstimulated cd4+ t-cells upon meth treatment, we observed significant increases in cd25 and hla-dr. we also observed increased expression of the activation markers cd69 and cd45ro, and a modest decline in the naïve cd4+ t-cell marker cd45ra. in addition, after meth treatment of unstimulated cd4+ t-cells, we observed significant increases in the expression of mir-34c and mir-155. transcriptional upregulation of mir-34c has been shown to occur during activation of cd4+ t-cells. further, both of these mirnas are reported to promote hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells35.these findings indicate that meth can act as an activator of cd4+ t-cells which could contribute to enhanced hiv-1 infection. our finding corresponds to a clinical study by massanella et al., where they observed enhanced cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell proliferation, and cd4+ t-cell activation and exhaustion in meth using hiv-1-infected art-suppressed individuals16.our study showed that meth significantly increased intracellular [ca2+] and camp levels in cd4+ t-cells. meth is known to induce increased cytosolic calcium concentration flux and camp release in neuronal cells20,31. both of these pathways play major roles in t-cell signaling and activation, and are involved in downstream regulation of the transcription factors nfκb, creb and nfat132. interestingly, the nfκb/sp1 complex has been shown to mediate enhanced hiv-1 transcription in t-cells14. in addition, creb has been shown to play a role in meth addiction and activation of neuroinflammatory signaling pathways21. we observed increased phosphorylation and enhanced nuclear translocation of these transcription factors in meth treated cd4+ t-cells. nfat1 is a positive regulator of gene transcription of several cytokines including il-4 and il-1033,34. consistent with these studies, we observed enhanced il-4 and il-10 gene transcription in meth treated cd4+ t-cells. from our findings, we infer that meth induces activation of ca2+ signaling and camp pathways which may be involved in the abnormal activation and regulation of cytokine gene expression in cd4+ t-cells.meth induced cd4+ t-cell activation via the sigma-1 receptor. involvement of the sigma-1 receptor was also implicated in meth mediated activation of astrocytes via src, erk/ mitogen-activated protein kinase, and creb pathways19. indeed, in our study we found meth treatment similarly led to the activation of these downstream signaling pathways. furthermore, enhanced nuclear translocation of creb may have interacted with the promoter of the sigma-1 receptor resulting in the enhanced expression of the sigma-1 receptor in cd4+ t-cells.mirnas are implicated in various biological processes including drug addiction and as modulators of post-transcriptional gene expression23,46,47. recently, liu et al. reported significant downregulation of ago2, indicating that mirna downregulation may be due to inhibition of ago2 mediated splicing of precursor mirna and not due to inhibition at the transcriptional level23. consistent with this study, we observed proteasomal degradation of ago1, that may have resulted in altered structural integrity of p-bodies, which play key roles in silencing of target mrnas. interestingly, prior studies have shown that during t-cell activation, ago proteins undergo proteasome mediated degradation36. this further confirms meth as a novel activator of cd4+ t-cells.in sum, we elucidate several mechanisms through which meth can enhance hiv-1 replication in cd4+ t-cells, and act as a novel activator of cd4+ t-cells through upregulation of mir-34c-5p and increased expression of several cd4+ t-cell activation markers. consistent with this new insight into the drug as a t-cell activator, we found that meth alone and in combination with hiv-1 infection induced extensive ago1 degradation, which can result in loss of structural integrity of p-bodies and formation of mirna induced silencing complexes, and has been linked to decreased anti-viral response and increased hiv-1 transcription48. we also show that meth mediated activation of t-cells resulted in activation of the transcription factors nfκb, creb and nfat1, which may contribute to increased hiv-1 replication and production of inflammatory cytokines. thus, multiple molecular mechanisms emanating from meth as a t-cell activator likely contribute to enhanced hiv-1 pathogenesis in drug using individuals and provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies to limit hiv-1 in these individuals.materials and methodscells, hiv-1 and constructsbuffy coats were obtained from the blood transfusion service, massachusetts general

HIV-infected macrophages and microglia that survive acute infection become viral reservoirs by a mechanism involving Bim,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12758-w,Research,9 October 2017,yes,"while hiv kills most of the cells it infects, a small number of infected cells survive and become latent viral reservoirs, posing a significant barrier to hiv eradication. however, the mechanism by which immune cells resist hiv-induced apoptosis is still incompletely understood. here, we demonstrate that while acute hiv infection of human microglia/macrophages results in massive apoptosis, a small population of hiv-infected cells survive infection, silence viral replication, and can reactivate viral production upon specific treatments. we also found that hiv fusion inhibitors intended for use as antiretroviral therapies extended the survival of hiv-infected macrophages. analysis of the pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways indicated no significant changes in bcl-2, mcl-1, bak, bax or caspase activation, suggesting that hiv blocks a very early step of apoptosis. interestingly, bim, a highly pro-apoptotic negative regulator of bcl-2, was upregulated and recruited into the mitochondria in latently hiv-infected macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. together, these results demonstrate that macrophages/microglia act as hiv reservoirs and utilize a novel mechanism to prevent hiv-induced apoptosis. furthermore, they also suggest that bim recruitment to mitochondria could be used as a biomarker of viral reservoirs in vivo.
introduction a major challenge to eradicate hiv is the formation of long-lasting hiv reservoirs that are resistant to antiretroviral therapy (art). the best recognized and examined viral reservoir corresponds to different cd4+ t cell populations, including naïve and memory cd4+ t cells. infection of both populations has been extensively reported in hiv-infected individuals1. it is believed that this pool of hiv-infected cells corresponds to <0.05% of circulating cells during asymptomatic infection under effective art2.it is widely accepted that monocyte/macrophage lineage cells are among the first cells targeted by hiv3, and that these cells then allow the virus to spread rapidly by transmission to cd4+ t cells4,5,6. macrophages are terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells derived from circulating monocytes and reside in various tissues, where they are referred to by different names, such as perivascular or alveolar macrophages, kupffer’s cells in the liver, or microglia in the brain7. under inflammatory conditions, macrophages derived from recently transmigrated monocytes die after few days8, whereas microglia, perivascular, and alveolar macrophages can survive for long periods – from weeks to years9,10,11. the properties of mobility, capacity for tissue infiltration, and extended survival have been proposed by several groups to be critical for the role of macrophages in the generation, stability, dissemination, and reactivation of hiv reservoirs. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that macrophages alone can sustain hiv replication in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that macrophages are a primary target of hiv and may help transmit the infection to other cell types12,13. nevertheless, the role of monocyte/macrophages as hiv reservoirs has been largely ignored.although hiv infection kills most cd4+ t cells, infected macrophages survive for extended periods by harboring the virus in cell membrane invaginations that protect virions from antiretroviral treatment (art) and circulating neutralizing antibodies14,15,16. to understand how hiv promotes survival of some infected cells that ultimately become viral reservoirs, several mechanisms of hiv-mediated effects on apoptotic pathways have been examined. several studies have demonstrated the effects of viral proteins on apoptotic protein expression including bcl-2, bax, flice inhibitory protein (cflip) and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (xiap)17,18. however, most of these studies have been performed in primary and t-cell lines, while the mechanisms of extended survival and viral transmission by hiv-infected macrophages are still unknown.here we demonstrate that hiv-infected human microglia and macrophages function as viral reservoirs. we show that these cells survive hiv infection for extended periods of time by avoiding apoptosis and serving as long lasting viral reservoirs. we also identify that accumulation of bim in the mitochondria of surviving hiv-infected cells does not result in apoptosis and that bim in the mitochondria could be used as a biomarker of viral reservoirs in vitro and in vivo.resultshiv infects and induces apoptosis in human microglia, but a small population of hiv-infected microglia survives the infectionto understand the dynamics of apoptosis in hiv-infected microglia, human fetal microglia were isolated, infected with hivada, and stained with dapi, tunel and hiv-p24 to quantify survival of uninfected and hiv-infected cells for up to 120 days. uninfected cultures of human microglia underwent sustained apoptosis after 21 days in culture (fig. 1a). hiv infection of microglial cultures resulted in faster initial apoptosis as compared to uninfected cultures up to 21 days (fig. 1a, *p ≤ 0.007). however, after 21 days post infection, survival of microglial cultures remained stable and higher than uninfected cultures (fig. 1a, *p ≤ 1.3 × 10−4). to determine whether uninfected or hiv-infected cells were surviving hiv infection, staining for dapi (to observe the nuclei), phalloidin (to observe the shape of the cells), and hiv-p24 (to detect hiv infection) was performed using staining and subsequent microscopy analysis. the results showed that most surviving microglia in the hiv-infected cultures were hiv-p24 positive (fig. 1a, 95.27 ± 4.68%) and corresponded to multinucleated cells (82.84 ± 20.09%), indicating hiv infection protects a small population of hiv-infected microglia from apoptosis.figure 1human microglia are hiv reservoirs. (a) determination of human microglia survival after hiv infection by tunel staining. to determine apoptosis, we perform tunel in combination with hiv-p24 staining and the number of positive and negative cells were quantified by microscopy. lines with circles account for the survival of uninfected cultures which died after 21 days in culture. however, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced in hiv-infected cultures. lines with squares represent the survival/apoptosis of hiv-infected cultures of microglia (a mix of uninfected and hiv-infected cells. hiv infected alone in the mixed culture are plotted as a line with triangles).to determine the apoptosis of just the hiv-infected microglia, we quantify apoptosis in hiv-p24 positive cells only in the mixed cultures of uninfected and hiv-infected cells. lines with upper triangles represent apoptosis of hiv-infected cells. minimal changes in the rate of apoptosis were detected in these cells during the time course examined (n = 3). (b) time course of hiv replication in human microglia exposed to hivada. viral replication was measured by hiv-p24 elisa (n = 4 different donors). lines with circles represent uninfected cultures. lines with squares represent hiv replication of human microglia. all points are significantly different from control conditions except by times 0 and 120 days. hiv-p24 secretion was undetectable after 120–150 days in culture. (c) using the same hiv-infected microglia described in (b), with undetectable replication, after 120–150 days post infection, cells were treated with different factors to reactivate replication. treatment of latently infected primary cultures of microglia results in viral reactivation. in microglia, saha, pha, lps, methamphetamine (meth), and the combination of tnf-α plus ifn-γ results in viral reactivation as compared to control conditions (p < 0.05, n = 3).full size image
surviving hiv-infected microglia become latently infectedto examine the dynamics of hiv replication within the infected microglia, we measured levels of hiv-p24 in culture supernatants by elisa. hiv replication reached a plateau between 28 to 36 days post infection and then decayed to undetectable levels after 120 days post-infection (fig. 1b). although the medium was concentrated ten times using amicon filters (50 kda, emd millipore, germany), no secreted hiv-p24 was detected by elisa at 120 days suggesting that viral replication becomes silent (data not shown).analysis of the surviving cells by microscopy and facs indicates that they maintain their macrophage phenotype including iba-1, cd14, cd68, cd11b/c, cd163, and csf1r expression as well as their phagocytic function, cytokine secretion (tnf-α, il-1β, and il-6), and migratory properties in response to ccl2 as described (19,20,21,22 and data not shown). in conclusion , all surviving cells correspond to macrophages or microglia, are infected with hiv, and become latently infected.latently hiv-infected microglia can be induced to reactivate viral replicationcritical features of viral reservoirs are extended survival, “hiding” the virus by suppressing viral replication and having the capability of reactivating the virus and spreading it to other cells12,23,24,25,26,27. to demonstrate that surviving hiv-infected microglia are latently infected, we induced hiv reactivation after 120-150 days post infection, when no hiv-p24 production is detected, using several factors known to be involved in cns and peripheral hiv reactivation12,24. next, we evaluated hiv replication by quantifying hiv-p24 secretion into the tissue culture medium for additional 21 days post treatment (fig. 1c). surviving latently hiv-infected microglia were treated with saha (n-hydroxy-n′-phenyl-octanediamide, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, 1 and 10 ng/ml), pha (1 µg/ml), dkk1 (10 and 100 ng/ml), il-1β (10 u/ml), methamphetamine (1 µm, meth), lps (1 µg/ml) or tnf-α (10 ng/ml) and/or ifn-γ (1 ng/ml). dkk1, ifn-γ and il-1β did not reactivate viral replication (data not shown). however, saha, pha, meth, lps and the combination of tnf-α and ifn-γ induced significant viral reactivation (fig. 1c). in conclusion , the small microglial population that survives acute hiv infection and silences hiv replication can be induced to reactivate the virus upon specific treatments. thus, these surviving cells fit the criteria of hiv reservoirs.hiv integrates into the host dna, produces viral mrna, replicates, and spreads among human macrophagesdue to the limited numbers of microglia isolated from brain tissue, subsequent experiments were performed using human macrophages. despite the various manuscripts demonstrating active hiv infection and replication in macrophages13,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, it is still considered controversial that macrophages become infected by hiv mainly because macrophages can store cell-free virions within plasma membrane invaginations for at least a month15,35,36,37,38. thus, to clarify whether macrophages are truly hiv infected, we analyzed hiv integration by multiple techniques, including fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) in combination with immunofluorescence, alu-pcr, mrna and hiv protein staining, as well as measurements of cell to cell dissemination at different time points (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-infection).using fish in combination with immunofluorescence, we detected hiv-dna nef integration into the host dna only in hiv infected cultures as early as 24 h post infection and up to 21 days post-infection (fig. 2a, hiv), where viral replication became undetectable (fig. 2e). no hiv-dna nef staining was detected in uninfected macrophages; only alu repeats, dapi and actin showed strong signals as expected (fig. 2a, control). these cultures were 99–100% positive for the macrophage marker iba-1, indicating no t cell contamination (data not shown). alu-gag pcr confirmed hiv integration into the host dna after 7 days post infection (fig. 2b). furthermore, analysis of viral rna expression using rnascope indicated that hiv gag mrna was produced in macrophages during the entire time course, while no hiv gag mrna was detected in uninfected cultures (fig. 2c) or using a scrambled probe (data not shown). we also analyzed the intracellular expression of hiv protein p24 (hiv-p24), by cell immunostaining and by elisa of the culture supernatant (fig. 2d and e, respectively). hiv infection of macrophages induced the expression and release of hiv-p24 in a time-dependent manner (fig. 2d and e, p ≤ 0.0001, n = 3). the increase in hiv-p24 in the culture supernatant from 7 to 14 days post infection confirmed that hiv infection of macrophages was productive. after 14 days hiv replication decreased indicating that some of the hiv-infected macrophages become latently infected (fig. 2e). furthermore, hiv was disseminated in a time-dependent manner: the first cycles of replication only infected 8.2 to 32% of all cells (fig. 2f, 15.69 ± 12.75%) but after 21 days post infection 100% of the cells were infected (fig. 2f, *p ≤ 0.0001, n = 3) but hiv replication was undetected (fig. 2e). together, these data indicate that hiv efficiently integrates into macrophage dna, produces viral mrna, and expresses hiv proteins. furthermore, the increase in hiv-p24 production in the culture supernatant, as well as the spread of infection over 21 days post infection, indicate that macrophages are productively infected upon exposure to hiv. but also our data demonstrate, like microglia, macrophages become latently infected after 21 days post infection despite that 100% of the cells have integrated hiv dna.figure 2hiv infection of macrophages is productive. pbmcs were isolated by ficoll gradient centrifugation, and macrophages were isolated by adhesion in the presence of m-csf for 7 days. macrophages were incubated with 50 ng/ml hivada and maintained in culture for further use for fish, fluorescence microscopy, pcr, or elisa. (a) a representative example of hiv-nef dna probe used to identify hiv dna integration into the host dna. a representative example of hiv dna insertion into the host dna after 7 days post infection with hivada is shown. control (uninfected) cultures did not bind a fluorescent signal, whereas hiv treated cultures acquired the hiv dna (green staining) colocalizing with other nuclear markers, dapi (blue) and dna alu repeats (white staining). both dna probes (hiv-nef and endogenous alu) had near perfect colocalization with dapi in hiv-infected cultures (hiv). iba1 (red) was used as a macrophage marker, n = 3. quantification of hiv-infection was performed by microscopy. positive hiv-infected cells correspond to cells with nef dna in the nucleus with perfect colocalization with dapi and alu repeat probes. (b) alu-gag pcr of macrophage cultures infected with hivada for 7 days post infection. β-globulin was used as a reference gene for fold change calculations. alu-gag did not amplify in control (uninfected, ui) cultures (n = 3), while hiv treated cultures amplified in just over 20 cycles (n = 3). β-globulin amplified in all lysate (ct = 32.46 ± 0.99, n = 6). relative fold change calculations of alu-gag from control to hiv treated cultures using β-globulin as a reference gene (*p = 0.0187, n = 3). (c) a representative example of hiv-gag rna probe after 7 days post infection with hivada. control (uninfected) cultures did not produce an hiv rna fluorescent signal, whereas hiv treated cultures produced a fluorescent signal (red). iba1 (green) was used as a marker for macrophages, and dapi (blue) was used to mark nuclei. interspersion of mrna within subcellular locales of hiv treated cultures was unremarkable (n = 3). (d) a representative example of hiv-p24 antibody staining with biotin-streptavidin amplification of fluorescence after 7 days post infection with hivada. control (uninfected) cultures did not produce a fluorescent signal, whereas hiv treated cultures produced a fluorescent signal (cyan, hiv-p24). dapi (blue) and actin (phalloidin, green) were used as cell markers (n = 3). (e) the supernatant was collected daily for 28 days post infection to determine hiv release into the extracellular media using elisa. hiv-p24 was not detected in control (uninfected cultures) and was thus significant at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection in cultures exposed to hiv (p ≤ 9.612 × 10−5, n = 6). beyond 21 days post infection, significant levels of hiv-p24 above control were not detected. (f) percentage of hiv-infected macrophages assessed by hiv-p24 staining. macrophage cultures were fixed and stained for fluorescent microscopy using the same method described for fig. 2d. the percentage of infected macrophages increased to significance at 3 days postinfection and continued until 100% infection at 21 days post infection (*p values ≤ 0.015. n = 5).full size image
hiv infection of human primary macrophages results in massive apoptosis, but a small population of hiv-infected cells survives the infectionto determine whether hiv infection results in survival of some hiv-infected macrophages; cells were stained for nuclei (dapi staining), actin (phalloidin staining), and tunel at different time points (0 to 21 days post infection) and we quantified the numbers of cells in 10 different fields using microscopy. cultures of uninfected macrophages showed low levels of apoptosis up to 21 days in culture in a similar manner compared with primary microglial cultures. hiv infection of macrophage cultures resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of macrophages in the cultures, as compared to uninfected cultures (fig. 3b, p ≤ 2.14 × 10−7, n = 3). a small but stable population of macrophages survived infection up to 21 days (the last point assayed; fig. 3c). most of the surviving cells were positive for hiv-p24 and contained hiv integrated dna as well as showed clear signs of cell to cell fusion (fig. 3d, hiv). hiv-infected fused macrophages have been described in vitro and in vivo, but not examined in detail, in multiple tissues even during the art era39,40,41,42,43. in conclusion , these data indicate that similar to hiv-infected microglia, a small population of hiv-infected macrophages survive acute infection and become latently infected.figure 3hiv infection of human primary macrophages results in massive apoptosis and survival of a small population of latently infected macrophages. macrophages were isolated using the same methods as in fig. 2, and cells were fixed at 7, 14, and 21 days post infection. cells were stained to identify nuclei (dapi, blue staining), cell shape (actin/phalloidin, green staining), and apoptosis (tunel, red staining). tunel positive macrophages were not counted as viable, with exceptions for cases of multinucleated cells.

surviving fused hiv-infected macrophages are generated by the cell to cell fusioncurrently, they are at least four different mechanisms of multinucleation described in different diseases. first, it has been proposed that cell-to-cell fusion is not truly a result of fusion but instead correspond to phagocytosis of damaged cells40,44. the second mechanism is due to incomplete mitosis40,45; however, macrophages are terminally differentiated and do not divide. third, cell to cell fusion by mechanisms involving il-4, cd44, sirp-α, macrophages fusion receptor (mfr)46,47 and p2x7 (see review by48). fourth, a mechanism of hiv-induced cell fusion has between proposed involving gp120, gp41, ccr5, and cd449 (fig. 4a).figure 4fused hiv-infected macrophages are generated by cell-to-cell fusion and not by phagocytosis of dying cells. (a) our proposed model of cell-to-cell fusion of neighboring hiv-infected macrophages. top two circles represent neighboring macrophages infected with hiv and containing hiv env proteins gp120/gp41 (red bulbs/yellow stalks) in proximity with endogenous cd4 and ccr5 (green bulbs, blue wave). red outlined insert represents moment just before cell-to-cell fusion in which all components necessary are present on the neighboring cell membrane. the dark arrow represents fusion steps that result in cell-to-cell fusion, where the product of fusion is represented just below the arrow. (b) representative fusion event captured by time-lapse imaging. hiv-infected macrophages were maintained in 60 mm culture dishes until cell to cell fusion was evident by light microscopy, then transferred to an incubated microscope with time-lapse capabilities. in this typical case, cell to cell fusion was captured after 3 days post infection, and fusion of two neighboring cells occurred in approximately 30 minutes. the fusion of two cells is denoted by “*” and “#”, and frames presented identify cellular events that are consistent with cell-to-cell fusion. frame 1 depicts neighboring cells before fusion. frame 2 illustrates the fusion point between cells (yellow arrow). note the cell membrane between the two cells is nearly indistinguishable. frame 3 illustrates the point at which the borders of the two neighboring cells are indistinguishable, with a southeastern invagination the only indicator that the new cell was once part of a pair. frame 4 depicts the completion of the fusion event. note that the size of the resultant cell is nearly the additive size of the original cells marked “*” and “#” from frame 1.

to test the third mechanism, we used oxidized atp (oatp, 100 µm) to block purinergic receptors including p2x7, and probenecid (500 µm) to block pannexin and connexin hemichannels that control the release of atp into the extracellular medium. we found that neither of these inhibitors altered cell to cell fusion in response to hiv infection (data not shown), suggesting that cell to cell fusion in hiv-infected condition is by an alternative mechanism. to determine whether the presence of multinucleated cells was the result of fusion or phagocytosis, live cell imaging of uninfected and hiv-infected cultures of macrophages was performed. no cell to cell fusion was detected in uninfected cultures (data not shown). however, exposure of macrophage cultures to hiv resulted in the significant cell-to-cell fusion as early as 2-3 days post-infection (fig. 4b, 3 days post infection and 30 min of live cell imaging, see * and #). in contrast, using live cell imaging, no phagocytosis was detected in uninfected or hiv-infected conditions (data not shown). to further determine whether cell to cell fusion was present in our hiv-infected cultures, scanning electron microscopy of macrophages in the process of fusion was performed (fig. 4c, inset). our data indicate a clear continuous membrane between the two cells in the process of fusion (fig. 4c, arrow). together these data suggest that the generation of multinucleated cells in response to hiv infection was a product of cell to cell fusion and not an artifact of phagocytosis, atp-mediated cell-to-cell fusion or incomplete mitosis.hiv fusion inhibitors decreased hiv replication but increased the survival of hiv-infected macrophagesto examine whether interaction between hiv-infected cells and host receptors (cd4 and ccr5) involved in cell to cell fusion participates in the survival of hiv-infected macrophages, cultures were infected with hiv for 24–48 hours to enable successful hiv integration and replication and then treated with hiv fusion blockers t20 (1 µg/ml) or tak779 (1 µg/ml). while cell to cell fusion was not altered at any time point in the hiv-infected macrophage cultures treated with tak779 and t20, we did observe a significant (∼99%) decrease in hiv replication (fig. 5a). furthermore, tak779 and t20 treatment of hiv-infected cultures resulted in a higher numbers of hiv-infected surviving macrophages after 21 days post infection, suggesting that these fusion inhibitors increased the survival of the infected cells (fig. 5b). tak779 and t20 treatment also protected non-multinucleated cells present in the hiv-infected cultures from apoptosis (fig. 5c). microscopy analysis of the surviving cells in the hiv-infected cultures treated with tak779 at 21 days indicates that fusion was still present, and most cells had undetectable to minimal hiv-p24 staining (fig. 5d, hiv + tak-21 days, compare to fig. 3d). these results indicate that after initial infection and replication, antiretrovirals such as tak779 and/or t20 extended the survival of latently infected cells. in conclusion , multinucleation was independent of viral production after initial infection, and hiv fusion inhibitors had an unexpected protective effect on the survival of infected macrophages.figure 5fusion inhibitors decreased hiv replication and increased the survival of latentlyhiv infected macrophages. to assess the survival of hiv-infected macrophages in the presence of fusion inhibitors, macrophages were infected with hivada, and fusion inhibitors were applied 24–48 hours later. this allowed for infection to establish before application of fusion inhibitors to determine whether fusion inhibitors were useful for inhibiting the formation of mgcs. the supernatant was also collected for application with elisa. (a) elisa for hiv-p24 at 21 days post infection in the presence of fusion inhibitors tak779 (tak), t20 or hiv alone. fusion inhibitors tak and t20 reduced hiv-p24 production collected from the supernatant (#p ≤ 0.0148 as compared to hiv alone, n = 3). control cultures did not produce an elisa signal above background (ui). supernatant from hiv alone cultures contained 196.5 ± 76 pg/ml hiv-p24, a significant increase from control cultures (*p = 0.0112, n = 3). supernatant collected from hiv infected cultures treated with tak or t20 also contained a significant amount of hiv-p24 compared with control cultures, 16 ± 8 pg/ml, and 5 ± 2 pg/ml respectively (*p ≤ 0.0123, n = 3). the amount of hiv-p24 in the supernatant of infected cultures treated with tak or t20 did not significantly differ from each other. the amount of hiv-p24 in supernatant from hiv alone cultures was significantly higher than both tak779 and t20 treated cultures (#p ≤ 0.015, n = 3). (b) fusion inhibitors prevented apoptosis of fused hiv-infected macrophages. hiv-infected cultures had significant cell death as compared to ui cultures (*p ≤ 0.0018, n = 3). cultures treated with tak779 or t20 contained more hiv-infected macrophages than hiv-alone cultures (#p = 0.0467 as compared to hiv alone, n = 3), indicating tak and t20 treatment prevented cell death of hiv-infected macrophages over 21 days post infection, up to 28 days the last point assayed. (c) quantification of non-fused cells reveals that tak treatment improved survival of non-fused macrophages (most uninfected cells) after exposure to hiv (#p ≤ 0.0341; &p ≤ 0.0428). t20 had no effect compared to hiv-alone cultures (n = 3). (d) an example of cultures treated with tak779 (tak) for 24 h and subsequently infected with hivada to demonstrate the lack of staining for hiv-p24, significant multinucleation, and cell death as compared to fig. 3d.full size image
hiv-infected macrophages are protected from hiv-associated apoptosisa key event in apoptosis is the formation of the transition pore in the mitochondrial membrane and the release of mitochondrial factors, such as cytochrome c, into the cytoplasm50,51. we have reported that hiv infection of human astrocytes results in bystander apoptosis of uninfected neighboring cells by a mechanism that involves the release of cytochrome c (cytc) into the cytoplasm52,53. cytc does not induce apoptosis in the infected astrocytes, but the spread of ip3 and calcium signals through gap junction channels causing apoptosis of uninfected neighbor cells52,53. it is well established that the equilibrium between expression, protein-protein interaction, and formation of the transition pore by pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins determines the apoptotic fate of the cell54,55,56. for instance, anti-apoptotic bcl2 protein promotes maintaining mitochondrial outer membrane pore integrity by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins that participate in pore opening57. t cell lines engineered to overexpress bcl2 have been used as a model to study latency and reactivation58. however, primary cells that survive infection with clinically relevant strains of hiv have never been found to contain elevated levels of bcl259,60,61 and if these mechanisms operate in surviving hiv-infected macrophages is unknown.here we analyzed the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial outer membrane (mom) pore integrity and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial fusion, and apoptosome formation including bcl-2, bak, bax, bim, mfn-1, xiap, apaf-1, mcl-1, hsp70, mfn2, hsp27, aif, and caspase -3 and -9. no changes in protein levels or protein cleavage of these protein was detected (data not shown and fig. 6a). the only protein affected was bim. we found that only bim expression was upregulated in hiv-infected macrophage cultures after 21 days post-infection, or the time when only a few latently hiv-infected macrophages remain in culture (fig. 6a and b). in contrast, bim expression was stable in uninfected cultures (fig. 6b). also, no changes in the three bim isoforms (el, l, and s) were detected in our cultured macrophages (data not shown) aside of the overall increased expression. these multiple bim isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and have been proposed to have different functions62. thus, trafficking of the protein into the mitochondria or protein-protein interaction with other apoptotic proteins may be affected. because bim is a highly pro-apoptotic protein63, the observation that bim expression was increased in the few surviving hiv-infected macrophages (fig. 6b) suggests that bim may have an alternative function in these cells or hiv blocks its apoptotic function.figure 6hiv-infected macrophages are protected from bim-associated apoptosis. macrophages were isolated and plated for the whole cell lysate collection or mitochondrial/cytoplasmic isolation for immunoblot. cells were infected with 50 ng/ml hivada, and the lysate was collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post infection. (a) whole cell lysate was probed for pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins that participate in mom pore opening (anti-apoptotic: bcl2; pro-apoptotic: bak, bax, bim). there was no significant change in the expression of bak, bax, bcl2, or mcl1 (data not shown) due to hiv infection (n = 3). pro-apoptotic protein bim was the only protein with significant changes of expression due to hiv infection. bim expression increased over 21 days post infection in hiv-infected macrophages when only latently hiv-infected macrophages remain in the culture. (b) quantification of bim expression in uninfected and hiv-infected macrophages. scanning and quantification of the band intensity were performed. we observe that only after 21 days post infection, bim was upregulated in the few surviving hiv-infected macrophages with undetectable hiv replication. (c) representative immunoblot analysis of the apaf-1, cytc, caspase-3, and gapdh. these essential components of the cytc apoptotic cascade apoptotic cascade are present, but not affected, during hiv infection of macrophages. caspase 3, the final executioner caspase during cytc mediated apoptosis was not activated (cleaved) during hiv infection over 21 days post infection (n = 3). gapdh was used as a loading control and used as a comparison protein for densitometric analysis. (d) representative mitochondrial/cytoplasmic fractionation of hiv-infected cells used to identify the movement of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space content in hiv-infected macrophages compared to control cells. tom20 was used to determine mitochondrial fractions, and gapdh was used to determine cytoplasmic fractions. aif or cytc presence in the cytoplasm of infected cells was not elevated during hiv infection (n = 5). however, bim was not detected in the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic fractions of control cells but was detected in these fractions during hiv infection after 21 days post infection (*p = 0.007, n = 3).full size image
hiv prevents initiation of apoptosis and formation of the apoptosometo examine the mechanisms by which hiv prevents apoptosis in a small population of hiv-infected macrophages, we examined protein expression levels of apaf-1, cytc, and caspase-3. we detected no changes in expression or activation of caspase-3 in response to hiv infection and no changes in the molecular weights of apoptotic proteins that would result from caspase-mediated cleavage or complex formation with other proteins (fig. 6c). also, to identify whether apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) or cytochrome c are released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, cell fractionation was performed in uninfected, and hiv-infected macrophages after 21 days post infection. our results indicate that aif and cytc are retained inside of the mitochondria (fig. 6d). thus, the apoptotic process is blocked. finally, to determine whether the mitochondria of the surviving hiv-infected macrophages are functional, we used mitotracker, a membrane potential-sensitive dye. no changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in the surviving hiv-infected macrophages as compared to uninfected cells, indicating that mitochondria are still functional (data not shown). together, these results indicate that apoptosis is not initiated in hiv-infected macrophages that survive acute hiv infection.increased bim mitochondrial association in hiv-infected macrophages and microglia in vitro and in vivo
bim is a highly pro-apoptotic protein in most cell types63 that is nevertheless highly upregulated in surviving hiv-infected macrophages where apoptosis is blocked (fig. 6b). normally bim associates with the cytoskeleton, but upon apoptosis activation, bim is recruited into the mitochondrial membrane to trigger apoptosis64. using cell fractionation experiments, we determined that bim was also recruited or sequestered into the mitochondria specifically in surviving latently hiv-infected macrophages (fig. 6d, mito fraction, hiv+). to examine whether bim also associated with mitochondria in vivo, we used human tissues (lymph nodes and brains) obtained from uninfected and hiv-infected individuals without detectable viral replication and performed immunostaining for bim, vdac (a mitochondrial protein), hiv-p24, and dapi.as expected, analysis of uninfected lymph nodes and brains showed no staining for hiv-p24 protein (fig. 7, control-ln and control brain, a and c). furthermore, in uninfected tissues diffuse bim and vdac staining was observed in lymph nodes (fig. 7a) and brains (fig. 7c). in contrast, in hiv-infected tissues obtained from individuals on effective art at the time of death (6-24 years of ar treatment), a few low expressing hiv-p24 infected cells were detected (fig. 7, hiv-ln and hiv-brain, b and c). these infected cells showed increased expression of bim in perfect colocalization with vdac, a mitochondrial protein (fig. 7b and d), consistent with our in vitro data indicating bim accumulates in mitochondria of hiv-infected cells in vivo. our results, in vivo, show that both t cells and macrophages have a similar profile of low expression of hiv proteins and bim recruited into mitochondria (1 positive cell in 108 to 1012 cells analyzed). thus, both cell types have a similar profile of bim. negative controls using iggs and control sera did not show any staining (data not shown). together, these data indicate that bim expression is increased and it is recruited to the mitochondria in surviving hiv-infected macrophages/microglia, suggesting that bim may be used as a biomarker to identify hiv reservoirs in vivo.figure 7bim is expressed in hiv reservoirs in the lymph nodes and the brain. human lymph node and brain tissue section obtained from uninfected and hiv-infected individuals without detectable plasma viral load for several years were subjected to confocal and 3d reconstruction. tissue was stained for nuclei (dapi, blue staining), bim (red staining), vdac (a mitochondrial marker, white staining) and hiv-p24 (hiv, green staining). uninfected tissue sections showed little and uniform bim and vdac staining. no staining for hiv-p24 was detected in uninfected tissue samples. human tissue sections of lymph node (a and b) and brain (c and d) obtained from uninfected (a and c) and hiv-infected individuals (b and d) without replication detected by years (6–24 years). (a and b) correspond to lymph tissue, mostly hiv-infected t cells, the proportion of hiv-positive cells was 1 cell per 108 to 1012. (c and d) correspond to human brain tissue sections obtained from uninfected and hiv-infected individuals. most hiv positive cells correspond to macrophage/microglia. there are not lymphocytes in the cns. similar rates of hiv-positive cells were detected in brain tissue. images from hiv-infected tissues correspond to the few hiv-infected cells detected in these tissues, but all hiv positive cells had bim accumulated in the mitochondria. bar: 12 µm.full size image
discussion the data presented here demonstrate that a small population of human microglia and macrophages survive acute hiv infection, that these surviving cells are hiv-infected but protected from apoptosis, and that hiv replication is silenced but can be reactivated in these cells. this indicates that these cells act as viral reservoirs. we found that formation of these reservoirs is associated with macrophage fusion and that cell fusion inhibitors extend the survival of hiv-infected cells. furthermore, we found that while apoptosis is blocked at an early step, the proapoptotic protein bim is upregulated and recruited into the mitochondria in latently infected macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. thus, we propose that bim association with the mitochondria is a potential biomarker of latently hiv-infected macrophages/microglia in vivo.the presence of fused macrophages, also known as multinucleated giant cells (mngc), has been reported extensively in the context of aids65. furthermore, several studies of non-aids conditions indicate the presence of fused cells in lymphoid organs66,67,68,69,70,71, hiv-associated lymphoepithelial cysts of the parotid gland71, and colonic mucosa72. thus, these fused cells are present in vivo, even during effective art, and are found in virally advantageous regions that are part of or are in close contact with lymphoid areas that can support viral reservoirs and reactivation.also, we found that hiv fusion inhibitors t20 and tak779 unexpectedly resulted in extended survival of a subpopulation of uninfected and hiv-infected macrophages, probably due to the reduction in hiv replication (fig. 2e). these results indicate that some kinds of art, i.e. those that prevent cell fusion, may extend the survival of hiv reservoirs by avoiding the toxic effects of high replication. our hypothesis involves two different mechanisms of cell protection induced by tak779 and t20. first, a protective effect of these antiviral drugs in latently hiv-infected cells mediated by prevention of cell death of hiv-infected cells as described in the results, but there may be a second mechanism of cell protection of uninfected cells, by preventing binding of the virus to cd4 and ccr5. a similar mechanism of cell death protection mediated by ccr5 has been described in several cell types73,74,75,76. this point requires further exploration because this indicates that some art may have negative effects on the survival of hiv reservoirs.although the hiv genome does not encode any apoptosis inhibitor proteins, several hiv proteins such as tat can upregulate host anti-apoptotic proteins including bcl-2, flip, xiap and c-iap277,78,79,80. also, hiv-nef induces phosphorylation and inactivation of bad, suggesting that alterations in the apoptotic process contribute to the survival of hiv-infected t cells81. however, we did not detect changes in expression of these apoptotic proteins in our latently hiv-infected macrophages. however, we cannot discard changes in protein-protein interactions, conformational changes, post-transcriptional modifications, or activity of the transition pore on the mitochondria altered by hiv infection. these studies will be the focus of future research. however, several laboratories have identified that the formation of transition pore is affected in other cell types, because overexpression or antagonist of bcl-2 can control hiv replication, reactivation, susceptibility to apoptosis, but the mechanism is unclear82,83,84,85,86.also, our previous studies of human astrocytes indicate that in infected astrocytes the transition pore in the mitochondrial membrane is formed, and cytc is secreted from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. hiv, however, blocks the subsequent formation of the apoptosome87,88,89,90. in contrast, we did not detect any evidence for the formation of the transition pore or secretion of mitochondrial factors into the cytoplasm in latently infected macrophages, indicating that hiv blocks formation or the function of the transition pore early during the apoptotic process. thus, the mechanism of how hiv promotes the survival of hiv- infected microglia and macrophages is different from those operating in t cells and astrocytes.a unique feature of surviving latently infected macrophages is the significant upregulation and recruitment of proapoptotic protein bim into the mitochondria (fig. 6b). bim downregulation in cancer cells is related to extended survival, metastasis and improved response to cytotoxic agents (reviewed in91,92). we propose that upregulation and sequestration of bim into the mitochondria in surviving infected macrophages reflects an early step in the apoptotic pathway, which is subsequently blocked by hiv because bim recruitment is not associated with apoptosome formation, secretion of cytc or aif into the cytoplasm, or activation of caspases. the upregulation of bim is currently used as a promising cancer therapeutic because upregulation of this protein can result in apoptosis63. however, in latently hiv infected cells in vitro and in vivo, bim did not lead to apoptosis despite its recruitment into the mitochondria. also, as indicated in the result section, there are no changes in expression or ratios the three different isoforms of bim. thus, the mechanism by which bim is blocking apoptosis of latently hiv-infected macrophages could be related to changes in host protein-protein interaction, the opening of the transition pore, or direct binding of hiv proteins to the pore. clearly, hiv is altering mitochondrial function/signaling/metabolism93,94, but the interplay between metabolism, survival and viral silencing/reactivation is totally unknown and currently is under active investigation in several laboratories.an additional explanation of the role of bim in the surviving hiv infected macrophages is its participation in the metabolism of viral reservoirs. survival of hiv infected macrophages results in mitochondrial fusion and changes in cell metabolism to promote survival of these cells including the use of alternative sources of fuel such as amino acids. thus, we propose that bim plays a role in metabolic regulation of the survival of these infected cells. interesting, bim during the formation of the transition pore also can interact indirectly with enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism such as creatine kinase, and hexokinase95. furthermore, both enzymes participate in hiv replication and viral reservoir formation93,96, but whether both set of proteins could regulate hiv reservoir metabolism is still under active investigation.in summary, we have obtained compelling evidence that macrophages/microglia function as hiv reservoirs, and that these viral reservoirs are formed by a novel mechanism involving bim upregulation and recruitment to mitochondria, which may be useful as a biomarker of viral reservoirs in vivo. these insights, together with the observation that fusion inhibitors increase the size of the latently hiv-infected macrophage pools, need to be incorporated into the current hiv reservoir paradigms and considered during the ongoing efforts to achieve hiv eradication.materials and methodsreagentsall reagents were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo) except in the places that are indicated otherwise. hivada, tak779, t20, soluble cd4 (scd4), were from the nih aids research and reference reagent program (germantown, md). primers and probes were obtained from biosynthesis (lewisville, tx) and pnabio (newbury park, ca). medium, penicillin/streptomycin (p/s), dyes and secondary antibodies were obtained from thermo-fisher (waltham, ma). human ab serum and fbs were from lonza (walkersville, md). hepes was from usb (cleveland, oh). hiv-p24 elisa was obtained from perkin-elmer (waltham, ma). antibodies to hiv-p24 were obtained from genetex (irvine, ca). all other antibodies were purchased from sigma, santa cruz (santa cruz, ca) or abcam (cambridge, ma). purified mouse igg2b and igg1 myeloma protein were from cappel pharmaceuticals, inc. tunel was obtained from roche ltd (germany). all experiments were performed under the regulations of rutgers university and the nih.microglia isolationhuman fetal cns tissue was used as part of an ongoing research protocol approved by rutgers university (irb protocols pro2012001303 and pro20140000794). microglia was established as previously described97. briefly, the tissue was minced and shaken. the slurry was passed through a 250 µm nylon mesh filter followed by a 150 µm filter, washed once with hbss, and then with complete dmem (dmem plus 25 mm hepes, 10% fcs, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids). cells were resuspended and seeded at 9 × 107 per 150 cm2 flask for 12 days. the medium, containing microglia, was then removed and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 220 × g. the microglia was resuspended in complete dmem and seeded according to the experiment required. microglia were infected with hiv and medium was collected every 3 days to measure hiv replication. all experiments performed in microglia were determining hiv-replication as determined by elisa and apoptosis or survival as determined by microscopy. the main limitation of these cultures is the numbers of microglia.monocyte isolation and macrophage culturehuman monocytes were isolated from leukopaks obtained from the new york blood center. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated by differential centrifugation using a ficoll gradient (ge healthcare, piscataway, nj). adherent cells were cultured for 7 days in the presence of 10 ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor (miltenyl biotec, san diego, ca) in rpmi 1640 with 10% fbs, 5% human ab serum, 1% p/s, and ten mm hepes to differentiate the cells into macrophages.hiv infection and replicationafter seven days in culture to enable differentiation, macrophages were inoculated with 20–50 ng/ml hivada for 24 hours, and then apoptosis, fusion, and expression of apoptotic proteins was examined. supernatants were collected, and the medium was changed every 24 hours until 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-inoculation. viral replication was analyzed by hiv p24 elisa according to the manufacturer’s instructions.live cell imagingto assess fusion, macrophages were imaged using a zeiss axioobserver z1 with an ld plan-neofluar 5x/0.4 10x air objective lens and a zeiss axiocam mrm camera using axiovision software. stage and objectives were housed within an incubation chamber maintained at 37 °c and 5% co2.hiv integration by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish)uninfected and hiv-infected macrophages were placed in an ultra-clean glass and incubated in probes directed to hiv-nef dna, and alu repeats as well as immunofluorescence for iba-1, a macrophage marker, and actin as well as dapi to label all the nuclei. the resolution of our equipment corresponds to 20 nm per pixel. thus, colocalization of dapi, hiv-nef dna, and dna-alu correspond to integrated hiv dna. this staining method enables us to detect few copies (even a single copy of hiv integrated dna) of integrated dna in the host dna, however, in this manuscript we did not quantify copy numbers, we only quantified negative versus positive cells. thus, we expect perfect colocalization between dapi, alu repeats, and the hiv integrated dna is hiv dna is inserted into the host dna.alu-gag pcrintegration of hiv into the host genome was detected by alu-gag pcr as described previously with minor variations98. the system was calibrated using om-10 cells and diluted om-10 cells into millions of uninfected hela cells to quantify the lowest numbers of copies possible in 108 to 1012 cells.
in situ gag rna analysisto examine the formation and localization of gag mrna, rnascope was used (newark, ca). however, we analyzed the data using fluorescence because localization of the rna is more informative than by colorimetric analysis. we used the same protocol described by the provider in combination with immunofluorescence to detect dapi (to label nuclei) and iba-1 (a macrophage marker) in the same cell.immunofluorescencehuman macrophages, hiv-infected and uninfected, were grown on glass coverslips, fixed and permeabilized in 70% ethanol for 20 min at −20 °c or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.01% triton-x for 2 minutes. cells were incubated in tunel reaction mixture (roche, germany) at 37 °c for 1 h, washed three times with pbs and incubated in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature. cells were incubated in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature and then in primary antibody (anti-hiv-p24 or isotype controls: both 1:50) overnight at 4 °c. cells were washed several times with pbs at room temperature and incubated with phalloidin conjugated to alexa fluor 488 (thermo-fisher, carlsbad, ca) to identify actin filaments and/or the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fitc (sigma, st. louis, mo) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by another wash in pbs for 1 h. then, cells were mounted using anti-fade reagent with dapi. cells were examined by confocal microscopy using an a1 nikon (tokio, japan) to quantify the total numbers of cells as well as tunel positive cells.western blot analysissamples were lysed with ripa buffer (cell signaling, beverly, ma) containing protease inhibitors (cell signaling, danvers, ma), and 50–80 µg of protein were electrophoresed on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel (bio-rad), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were probed with the mitochondrial antibodies described and developed with hrp (see original blots in supplemental fig. 1). densitometric analysis was performed using nih imagej software. the original gels are presented in supplemental figure 1.human tissue sectionshuman tissues were collected as part of the irb-approved for rutgers university and the manhattan hiv brain bank and national neuroaids tissue consortium (nntc). sections of 15 to 25 µm thickness were processed for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as described above (n = 11, four uninfected and five hiv-infected with no viral replication detected for 6–24 years, see table 1 for details).table 1 patient information.full size table
statistical analysisstatistical analyses were used to determine the significance of data from all experiments. significance was assessed by determining the validity of the null hypothesis that states that all treated groups were the same as their respective controls or hiv infection alone. origin 8 software was used to test the null hypothesis by comparing the relative value to a theoretical mean of 1 using a two-tailed, two sample t-test with a 95% confidence intervale.

"Investigation of prevention of mother to child HIV transmission program from 2011 to 2017 in Suzhou, China",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36623-6,Research,24 December 2018,yes,"the vertical transmission of hiv, from mother to child remains one of the biggest challenges all over the world. this study evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of the prevention of mother to child hiv transmission (pmtct) program from 2011 to 2017 in suzhou. a total of 107 hiv positive women were enrolled in the program, of which 11 were diagnosed through premarital examination, and 96 women were diagnosed through prenatal examination. among the 96 pregnant women, 67 gave birth to 68 live neonates. only one infant was diagnosed hiv infected because the hiv positive mother did not enter the pmtct program until delivery. the hiv prevalence in suzhou city showed a low-level tendency. to increase the prenatal health utility and antiretroviral medication compliance of the migrant population in suzhou, there are improvements to make in order to achieve the 90-90-90 targets.
introduction the high mortality rate and rapid transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) make it a worldwide public health problem, that is mostly spreading in the countries with middle and low financial resources1,2,3. there were approximate 36.7 million people living with hiv in 2016, and about 2.1 million of those were less than 15 years old4. as a result of the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, there is a downward trend of new hiv infections, especially in eastern and southern africa5. it was estimated that the number of children newly infected with hiv throughout the world declined by 47% from 2010 to 2016, as the rate of hiv positive pregnant women using antiretroviral therapy to prevent vertical transmission to their children rose from 47% to 76% during the same period6.the vertical transmission of hiv, which is the transmission of hiv from mothers to their children during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding, remains one of the most challenging public health problems all over the world7. the use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding is necessary for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hiv. there is evidence showing that starting antiretroviral therapy as early as possible has multiple benefits including protecting people living with hiv from aids-related illness and preventing hiv transmission6. the mother-to-child transmission of hiv (mtct) is the most common mode of transmission of hiv to children. the proportion of children newly infected with hiv through mtct is over 90%. the interventions aiming to prevent vertical transmission of hiv, improving life quality of hiv infected mothers and their children and protecting both mothers and their children from aids-related illness are known as prevention of mother to child transmission of hiv (pmtct)8,9.according to the implementation plan of the pmtct program in china, every pregnant woman who receives prenatal care for the first time or gives birth at a hospital, should receive hiv counseling and testing. when a pregnant woman is diagnosed as hiv positive, she will be referred to a specialized hospital for future examination and medication. free antiretroviral medications are provided to hiv positive women regardless of their cd4 + t lymphocyte count and viral load. these relevant tests should be carried out before and during the antiretroviral treatment, after which the therapeutic effects and hiv infection status are assessed in combination with the clinical symptoms.free antiretroviral medication should be provided to the infant as soon as possible (within 6 to 12 hours) after birth early diagnosis and hiv detection are performed at the 6th week and 3rd month after birth. regular follow-ups and physical examinations of the infants are performed at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th and 18th month after birth to determine whether there are infection symptoms. for exposed children who have not received early diagnostic tests, hiv antibody tests and if necessary supplementary tests should be carried out at the 12th and 18th month after birth to identify hiv infection.pmtct is one of the greatest public health successes of the past 20 years. the rate of mtct has been reduced to 1% or less when comprehensive prophylactic strategies are implemented10. the prevention measures include providing antiretroviral therapy for hiv pregnant women during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, providing antiretroviral medications to the infants, elective cesarean section delivery, advocating formula feeding and avoiding breast feeding. for women for whom breastfeeding is the only feeding option, taking antiretroviral medications during the whole period of breastfeeding is recommended by the world health organization (who)10,11.in the absence of intervention programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv, the risk of hiv transmission in the uterus and during childbirth is 15–30%, and the risk increases to 20–45% in the case of breastfeeding7. it has been reported that the worldwide expanded access to pmtct services can decrease the risk of vertical transmission of hiv to less than 2%, however, there has been less success in low-income countries due to a variety of factors such as insufficient knowledge of hiv of individuals and limited economic resources7,12,13.generally, the national hiv epidemic remains at a low-prevalence in china, but clusters of high prevalence exist in some areas of yunnan, xinjiang and henan14,15. despite the chinese government’s enormous efforts toward hiv/aids prevention and control, the hiv epidemic continues to grow. around the country, an estimated 4.37 per 100,000 people were living with hiv, and 3.21 per 100,000 people were identified as aids patients16. by the end of 2017, 2.39 per 100,000 people died of aids-related illness. hiv prevention has become one of the most severe challenges for national health and development.suzhou city is a national historical and cultural city located in the southeast of jiangsu province. nowadays suzhou is one of the most important central cities of the yangtze river delta and famous for the national high-tech industrial base. suzhou has a population of 10,684 million residents of which almost half are migrants. the economic development in suzhou has attracted a large migrant population, which includes both top talents and low-income workers. in 2017, the total number of pregnant women and live births in suzhou were 134,252 and 135,471 respectively, ranking first in jiangsu province.in jiangsu province, 1317 new hiv/aids cases were reported in 2017, and 199 patients died of aids. the incidence of hiv /aids was 0.165‰ in jiangsu. in suzhou 692 new hiv/aids cases were reported in 2017, a decrease of 4.0% compared to the same period the previous year. among the newly reported cases, male patients decreased by 7.0%, and female patients increased by 26.2% over the same period. the main transmission route was sexual transmission, including 59.1% male to male transmission and 40.3% heterosexual transmission. from 2012 to 2017, the newly reported male hiv/aids cases increased from 341 to 610, and the newly reported female hiv/aids cases increased from 34 to 82. the treatment rate increased from 58.1% to 90.1% and the mortality decreased from 3.9% to 1.4%.the program of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hiv/aids, syphilis, and hepatitis b is an important part of maternal and child health projects. the program is an important measure to protect women and children from aids, syphilis, and hepatitis b infection. according to the requirements of the national and provincial major maternal and child health project, suzhou launched the pmtct program in 2011, and integrated it with routine maternal and child health care. there are ten districts in suzhou city, the maternal and child healthcare institution in every district is responsible for reporting information on hiv positive pregnant women and the follow-up of hiv positive pregnant women and their children. if a pregnant woman is diagnosed as hiv positive, the medical staff at the maternal and child healthcare institutions will advise the patients to be referred to a specialized hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. all the hiv positive pregnant women give birth in this specialized hospital. these measures are implemented to improve the compliance of maternal antiretroviral medication use.after years of actively exploring suitable management mode for preventing mother to child transmission of aids, syphilis and hepatitis b in suzhou, the program has made some progress.resultsfrom the year 2011 to 2017, a total of 96 pregnant women were diagnosed with hiv during prenatal care examination. among these 96 hiv positive pregnant women, 14(14.58%) hiv positive women were local residents and 82(85.41%) women were from the migrant population. the majority of the hiv positive women, 76(79.17%), were of the han ethnic group and other 20(20.83%) were from ethnic minorities. among the ten districts in the city, zhangjiagang had the highest rate, reporting 23 hiv positive women during the past seven years. taicang had the lowest rate with three hiv positive women.from 2011 to 2017, the number of pregnant women and live births increased from 102,602 to 126,281 and 103,056 to 127,327, respectively (table 1). during those seven years, a total of 107 hiv positive women were reported by the pmtct program, of which 96 women were diagnosed through prenatal examination, and 11 women were diagnosed during pre-marital medical examination. the prevalence of hiv positive pregnant women showed an increase in these years, and this increase was statistically significant (χ2 = 14.16, p = 0.028). this increase was mainly due to two causes. one cause was an increased detection rate due to the scaled-up prenatal care examination; another cause was the accumulation of previously infected patients. of the hiv positive women, 66 were diagnosed during antenatal care, 15 around delivery, and 15 during other procedures such as artificial termination of pregnancy. the number of pregnant women diagnosed during antenatal care was higher than the number of diagnosed at other times, and the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 25.65, p = 0.012). the number of hiv positive pregnant women using antiretroviral medications was 57 (59.38%), and 52 of these received antiretroviral medications adherent to the program requirements. the rate of hiv positive pregnant women using antiretroviral medications from 2011 to 2017 varied, and the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 20.08, p = 0.003). the numbers of hiv positive women taking antiretroviral drugs during antenatal, delivery and postpartum also varied, and the difference was statistically significant (antenatal medication use: χ2 = 19.87, p = 0.003; delivery medication use: χ2 = 15.17, p = 0.019; postpartum medication use: χ2 = 17.52, p = 0.008).table 1 the basic information of pregnant women and hiv positive women from 2011 to 2017.full size tablethe average age of the hiv positive pregnant women was 27.99 ± 5.79 years (range:18 to 42 years), and the average age of their sexual partners was 27.03 ± 16.18 years. most pregnant women (n = 58, 60.42%) and their sexual partners (n = 51, 53.13%) were between 20 to 35 years old (table 2). the second largest age group of pregnant women (n = 33, 34.38%) and their sexual partners (n = 32, 33.33%) was below 20 years old. most of the hiv positive women (n = 51, 53.13%) and their sexual partners (n = 32, 33.33%) reported junior high school as highest education (table 2). according to the records, 54 of the hiv positive women were housewives, while the other women were mainly engaged in low- income work. the hiv positive women showed a tendency of low educational level, low age and low income.table 2 the educational background and age of hiv positive pregnant women and sexual partners.full size tablefrom the records of the pmtct reporting system, we know that 69 pregnant women were infected through sexual behavior, either by having sex with an hiv positive partner or by having paid sex, accounting for 71.9% of the transmission route. three women were infected through intravenous drug use and one through blood transmission. by comparison, 14 partners of the pregnant women were infected through sexual behavior, one through intravenous drug use and one by blood transmission, while of most partners no detailed information was available. detailed transmission information is shown in table 3.table 3 the transmission route of hiv positive pregnant women and sexual partners.full size tableof the 96 pregnant women, 67 pregnant women gave birth, 26 pregnant women underwent artificial termination of pregnancy, two women had a spontaneous abortion, and one was lost to follow up (table 4). of the 67 women who gave birth, 57 received selective caesarean sections, and ten had a vaginal delivery. of the women who gave birth, 21 women had pregnancy complications, of which preterm birth was the most common. four hiv positive women were co-infected with syphilis.table 4 the pregnancy outcomes and complications of hiv positive women.full size tablefrom the year 2011 to 2017, 67 hiv positive pregnant women gave birth to 68 neonates; only one woman gave birth to twins. there were 35 male neonates and 33 female neonates (table 5). the average weights of the male and female neonates were 2.96 ± 0.62 kg and 2.85 ± 0.42 kg respectively. the average birth weight of the males was significantly higher than of the females (χ2 = 174.26; p < 0.0001). the recommended antiretroviral regimens prescribed to the neonates born to hiv positive women were zidovudine (azt) or nevirapine (nvp). based on our records, all neonates were given antiretroviral drugs except for one female neonate. this lack of treatment was due to rejection by the family members. according to the follow-ups of the neonates, only one was diagnosed with hiv infection.table 5 the basic information of neonates.full size tablediscussion according to this study, from 2011 to 2017, the prevalence of hiv positive pregnant women increased gradually in the suzhou region. the overall hiv incidence among pregnant women is low. the migrant population and the population with a lower education level and income had a higher risk of being infected. the difficulty in ensuring the effective implementation of the program lies in enhancing the health awareness and medication compliance of the migrant population. suzhou has a large migrant population, accounting for more than half of the total population. the migrant groups usually do not seek antenatal care actively and regularly, leading to a large part of hiv positive women missing the opportunity for prenatal hiv counseling and testing, and consequently missing the antiretroviral therapy. this increases the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hiv. in the absence of comprehensive prevention measures, the risk of hiv transmission from mother to child could increase to 40%17. providing antiretroviral therapy to pregnant mothers could reduce the risk of infection to lower than 2%, increasing maternal and infant life expectancy18,19. according to the pmtct records, only one infant was diagnosed with hiv infection; this was probably because the hiv infected mother did not receive hiv counseling and testing until delivery. therefore she did not take antiretroviral medication during pregnancy. early diagnosis and treatment are the keys to prevent mtct of hiv.as a result of scaled-up hiv prevention services, hiv prevalence among children was 47% lower in 2016 than in 20116. hiv positive women of reproductive age are an important source of infection as they can infect both their sexual partners by sexual transmission and their children by vertical transmission. to eliminate the global mtct of hiv, it is necessary to expand the pmtct interventions. mtct of hiv can be almost completely prevented if both the mother and the infant receive arv treatment as early as possible during pregnancy and after birth. the priority actions recommended by the who include preventing hiv infections among women of reproductive age, helping hiv positive women avoid unintended pregnancies, ensuring pregnant women have access to hiv counseling and testing, and providing hiv positive pregnant women with antiretroviral medication to prevent transmission20.approximately 36.7 million people were living with hiv globally at the end of 2016, among them 1.8 million were newly infected21. there is no cure for hiv infection. effective antiretroviral drugs, however, can control disease progress so that people with hiv can have long and productive lives and can help prevent transmission. providing antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women is cost-effective. economic analyse found that investment in hiv treatment services can generate economic returns as a result of increased employment and productivity, and averted future expenses for medical services for both mother and offspring20,22. however, gender disparities in education and employment, along with power inequalities between women and men, and the fear of violence may increase hiv vulnerability and limit women’s access to hiv services or adherence to hiv prevention or treatment22,23,24,25,26,27. these make hiv prevention especially difficult for women.there are two sets of antiretroviral medication regimens recommended for pregnant women in pmtct program in china, one is the combination of zidovudine (azt), lamivudine (3tc) and rravavir/ritonavir (lpv/r), and another regime is the combination of tenofovirdisoproxilfumarate (tdf), lamivudine (3tc) and efavirenz (efv). after investigating the antiretroviral treatments of these 96 hiv positive women, only 59.38% of women took the antiretroviral medications; this rate was much lower than the recommended 90% of the program. a total of 39 women did not use antiretroviral medication at all, while five women did not receive standardized antiretroviral treatment of whom two did not take antiretroviral medication during the postpartum period, and three did not take antiretroviral medication both during childbirth and the postpartum period. even though the antiretroviral medications are free for hiv infected pregnant women, the compliance rate is much lower than expected. while all the hiv infected mothers were referred l to specialized hospitals for hiv diagnosis and were prescribed medications, some hiv infected mothers refused to follow the instructions as they concealed the infection information from family members. some pregnant women chose to undergo artificial termination of their pregnancy, the medication information of this group of women was not reported in the pmtct system. another factor that leads to a low antiretroviral medication rate was that some women did not recognize the importance of antiretroviral medications due to their low educational level.among the 68 neonates born to the hiv infected women, only one female neonate did not recieve antiretroviral medication. the overall rate of infants taking antiretroviral medication was 98.53%, which was lower than the recommended 100%. both the infant and her hiv infected mother both did not take the antiretroviral medication due to the parents’ rejection. the hiv positive women’s knowledge and enrolment are important to guarantee successful pmtct implementation. what’s more, the support of family members’ is also very important. most hiv infected women enrolled in the pmtct program were infected by unprotected sexual behavior. this made them feel embarrassed to talk about their infection status, even with family members or their husbands. the stigma of hiv positive women and the common social perception of hiv causes people at risk of hiv infection to rarely take the initiative to seek hiv counseling and testing in hospitals. the delayed diagnosis of hiv infected pregnant women lead to missed opportunity of taking antiretroviral medication.in 2014, the joint united nations program on hiv/aids (unaids) set the 90–90–90 targets to be reached by 2020. that is by 2020, 90% of people living with hiv will know their status, 90% of those diagnosed will take antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of people on treatment will suppress viral loads28. according to the reported data, substantial progress has been made towards the 90–90–90 targets. globally, more than two thirds of people living with hiv were diagnosed by 2016, 77% of those who knew their hiv status were taking antiretroviral therapy, and 82% of people on treatment achieved viral suppression6. achieving 90-90-90 by 2020 and scaling up to 95-95-95 by 2030 will reduce the number of new hiv infections by90% by 203029.the chinese government has made a great effort to achieve the 90–90–90 targets, there is however still a long way to go. our current research is the first study investigating the epidemiology of hiv in pregnant women in suzhou. even though the mother-to-child transmission of hiv was low according to the data presented, there is still room for improvement in the process and details of the program. to diagnose hiv positive pregnant women as soon as possible, it is better for women to visit the hospital seeking antenatal healthcare regularly. however, the healthcare awareness of some migrant groups is poor, and for the previously diagnosed hiv positive pregnant women, the degree of society’s acceptance of hiv and stigma of the patients make some hiv positive pregnant women avoid taking the initiative to seek counseling and testing. this leads to a part of hiv positive pregnant women not being included in the pmtct program. to increase population awareness of timely diagnosis and antiretroviral medication use against hiv/aids, it is necessary to introduce health education among the population rather than avoid talking about it. some hiv positive pregnant women concealed their hiv infection from their families, this could decrease the compliance of the patients. based on the patient’s privacy, medical staff could not share the patient’s information without the patient’s consent. however, hiv positive pregnant women are different from the common population, as their health also affects fetal health. this dilemma poses difficulties for medical treatment. solving this dilemma may depend on future policy adjustments. in addition to investigating the basic information of hiv positive pregnant women, the influence of the mental health of hiv positive pregnant women on medication use, the influence of viral load of the hiv positive pregnant women on fetal health, and other factors should be investigated as well. the pmtct program and the factors that influence it should be studied further to continue evaluation and improve the program for preventing hiv infection in suzhou.methodsdata collectionthe data used in this study were obtained from the pmtct program carried out in hospitals and maternal and child health care centers of suzhou from 2011 to 2017. from the year of 2011, suzhou began to implement the pmtct program and it covered all medical and health care institutions. there were specially trained staffs in charge of this program in these institutions, and they were responsible for collecting and reporting information. the staffs of municipal, county, and district-level maternal and child health care institutions were responsible for summarizing the data and information quality control.according to the requirements of the maternal health care management system and the pmtct program in suzhou, for all women receiving their first prenatal examination or delivering in a hospital, hiv testing and counseling are carried out. for pregnant women with a positive result in an hiv antibody screening test such as the rapid test (rt), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), chemiluminescence immunoassay (clia), or gelatin particle agglutination test (pa), a reexamination would be conducted using the original or another screening test. samples from women with positive results in the reexamination are further analysed with a supplemental antibody assay or a supplemental nucleic acid assay. based on the positive results of the supplemental assay, women were diagnosed hiv infection. all methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the national health commission of the people’s republic of china.for hiv positive pregnant women free antiretroviral drugs were provided at the designated hospital, as well as a series of prenatal examinations, and regular follow-ups until delivery. hospital delivery was provided for all hiv positive pregnant women. the neonates born to hiv positive mothers underwent early blood tests and were given antiretroviral drugs immediately after birth to prevent mother-to-child hiv infection. early diagnosis and hiv detection were performed at the 6th week and 3rd month after birth. venous blood of the infant was collected on dried blood spots (dbs) cards; the dbs cards were sent to the regional laboratory center for diagnosis. if the exposed children did not receive early diagnostic tests, hiv antibody and necessary supplemental tests were carried out at the 12th and 18th month to identify hiv infection. feeding guidance and regular child health care service were provided. the follow-ups and physical examinations were carried out to determine whether there were symptoms of infection at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after birth. for the children who did not carry out early blood test should receive supplementary tests in 12 and 18 month to identify the status of hiv infection.statistical analysisthe basic information of the hiv positive mothers including marital status, gravidity and parity history, educational background, date of hiv diagnosis, transmission route of hiv, information about the sexual partner, last menstrual period, current pregnancy outcome, and neonatal information were collected. the characteristics of the hiv positive mothers from 2011 to 2017 were analyzed. the statistical difference between the groups was evaluated by the χ2-test or fisher’s exact test as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the analyses were conducted using spss 17.0 software (chicago illinois, usa).ethical considerationsthis study was approved by the ethics committee of suzhou municipal hospital. the data were collected through routine information questionnaire. all infected mothers were required to complete the questionnaire when they received hiv testing at their first antenatal care or delivery. the informed consent was obtained from the hiv positive mothers. the testing results and antiretroviral treatment information were obtained from medical records. the study was approved by the ethics committee to link the two routinely collected data sets as a municipal pmtct database. in the final database used in this investigation, only the special numbers for mothers and infants were listed. all personal information was kept confidential.

Prevalence of hepatitis E infection in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in Spain (2012–2014),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37328-6,Research,4 February 2019,yes,"hepatitis e virus (hev) has emerged as a relevant pathogen for hiv-infected patients. however, there is scarce data on hev infection in hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals with advanced fibrosis, which seems to increase the risk of hev infection and worsen the prognosis of liver disease. we aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-hev antibodies, acute hepatitis e, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients and to evaluate associations with clinical and epidemiological characteristics. we performed a cross-sectional study on 198 hiv/hcv-coinfected patients, 30 healthy controls and 36 hiv-monoinfected patients. we found a low concordance between techniques used for detection of anti-hev antibodies (elisa versus immunoblot), particularly in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients. hiv/hcv-coinfected patients showed the highest prevalence of igg against hev, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev (19.2%, 17.2%, and 22.2% respectively). however, we did not find any samples positive for hev-rna nor significant differences between groups. moreover, hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with cd4 t-cells <350 cells/mm3 had higher prevalence for anti-hev igg antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev than healthy controls or those with cd4 t-cells ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (p = 0.034, p = 0.035, and p = 0.053; respectively). in conclusion , hiv/hcv-coinfected patients in spain have a high prevalence for igg anti-hev antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev; particularly patients with cd4+t-cells <350 cells/mm3.
introduction hepatitis e virus (hev) is transmitted by the fecal-oral route (contaminated water/food transmission), causes self-limiting hepatitis in humans without significant clinical implications in most cases, and is responsible for hepatitis e outbreaks worldwide1. hev is the most common cause worldwide of acute viral hepatitis with an estimated prevalence of 20 million, with 3.3 million symptomatic cases and 44,000 deaths per year2. in europe, hev infection has been described as an emergent viral hepatitis in the last years3, with seroprevalences ranging from 0.6 to 52.2%, as showed by a recent meta-analysis. in acute hev infection, anti-hev igm antibodies are detected at the time of clinical onset (3–4 days from the onset of jaundice) and remain detectable for 3–12 months. anti-hev igg antibodies appear shortly after the igm antibody response and persist for years4.hev prevalence in hiv-infected patients from european countries is from 0.95 to 26%, depending on the geographical location and study population. these rates are similar or higher than in the general population1,2,5, particularly for those with low cd4+ t-cell counts6. in this context, hev seroprevalence ranged from 9% to 26% in spanish hiv-infected patients7,8,9,10,11,12,13. therefore, hev has emerged as a relevant pathogen for hiv-infected patients, mainly ones with low cd4+ t-cell counts or immunosuppression due to solid organ or bone marrow transplant6. in this regard, hiv-infected patients coinfected with hev constitute a high-risk population for developing chronic hepatitis and the rapid progression of liver disease, but it is poorly understood in hiv-infected patients6.around 2.3 million subjects worldwide are infected with both human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and hepatitis c virus (hcv)14. there is little data on hev infection in hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals with advanced fibrosis, which seems to increase the risk of hev infection and worsen the prognosis of liver disease1. therefore, hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals constitute a population of particular interest since they have chronic hepatitis c with different stages of liver disease and a deregulated immune response that increases depending on the severity of liver disease15.in this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-hev antibodies, acute hepatitis e, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients and to evaluate associations with clinical and epidemiological characteristics.resultspatientsthe characteristics of the hiv/hcv-coinfected patients are shown in table 1. overall, the median age was 49 years, 76.8% were males, 49.7% had high alcohol intake, 79.1% acquired hiv by intravenous drug use, 29.1% had prior aids-defining conditions, and 98% were on combination antiretroviral therapy. furthermore, 19.4% had cd4+ t-cell <350 cells/mm3, 13.8% had values of hiv rna >50 copies/ml, 49.5% were cirrhotic, 71.1% were hcv-gt1 and 70.9% had hcv rna >850,000 iu/ml. table 1 shows the characteristics of the two control groups. the healthy controls were negative for hiv, hcv, and hbv infection. the hiv-monoinfected patients without hcv and hbv infection had undetectable hiv viral load and cd4 + > 500 cells/mm3, and all subjects were infected with hiv bisexual transmission (14 heterosexual and 22 homosexual).table 1 clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the subjects includes in the study.full size tableconcordance analysis between hev elisa and immunoblot assayswe tested the concordance between elisa and immunoblot techniques for the screening of anti-hev igm and igg antibodies by cohen’s kappa test (table 2). we found a weak concordance for anti-hev igm antibodies (kappa coefficient between 0 and 0.342) and moderate-good for anti-hev igg antibodies (kappa coefficient between 0.526 and 0.718). hiv-monoinfected patients and hiv/hcv-coinfected patients had the highest kappa coefficient values.table 2

patients and hiv-monoinfected patients had the highest prevalences of anti-hev igm antibody and acute hepatitis e, but no significant differences from healthy controls were found. moreover, we did not find any sample positive for hev-rna indicating that no patient had the possibility of chronic hepatitis e.table 3 frequencies of immunoglobulins against hev and clinical outcomes in the two control

cd4 t-cells <350 cells/mm3 had a higher prevalence of anti-hev igg antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev than healthy controls (p = 0.012, p = 0.020, and p = 0.006; respectively) and hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with cd4 t-cells ≥350 cells/mm3 (p = 0.034, p = 0.035, and p = 0.053; respectively) (fig. 1; full description in supplementary table 1). finally, significant differences in other analyzed epidemiological and clinical characteristics were not found (data not shown).figure 1summary of (a) immunoblot assay for igm and igg and (b) clinical outcomes against hepatitis e virus in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients according to cd4+ t-cell status. statistics: values expressed as number of cases (%). p-values were calculated by chi-squared test or fisher’s exact test as required.full size imagediscussion in this work the main findings were: a) the concordance between elisa and immunoblot assays was weak for anti-hev igm antibody and moderate-good for anti-hev igg antibody detection, making the confirmation test (immunoblot) necessary for hev antibody screening in order to have comparable data between cohorts; b) hiv/hcv-coinfected patients had a high prevalence (>15%)of anti-hev igg antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev; and (c) hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with cd4+ t-cells <350 cells/mm3 showed a higher prevalence (>25%) for anti-hev igg antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev than patients with cd4+ t-cells >350 cells/mm3 and healthy controls. however, we did not find any relationship between hev seroprevalence and the markers of liver disease, and no patient with a possible chronic hev infection was found either.there is limited data on hev infection in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients, despite the fact that numerous studies have been published on hiv-infected patients5. in spain there are several published works7,8,9,10,11,12,13 limited to a geographical area and presenting limited data in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients. this fact may lead to variability in hev prevalence, as has already been demonstrated16. according to the world health organization and the european centre for disease prevention and control, hev infection information for focused action is needed, particularly for those subjects considered as risk groups, such as patients with preexisting liver disease and immunocompromised status17,18. in this sense, our study contributes information on the hev prevalence in a population of hiv/hcv-coinfected patients, of which 50% had cirrhosis and around 25% lsm >25 kpa (patients with high risk of clinical progression).in our study we found disagreements between two serological techniques used for the determination of anti-hev igm and igg antibodies (elisa vs. immunoblot), reinforcing previous reports on the difficulties in hev diagnosis4. these discrepancies were higher in anti-hev igm antibodies than anti-hev igg antibodies. the cause of this discordance is poorly understood, but the genetic variability of hev and the differences in the antigens used for hev diagnosis could explain some of these differences, as well as the lack of a reliable gold standard that would provide confidence about a true “positive” or “negative” result4. in other studies, cross-reactivity in anti-hev serology tests has been described when there are infections with epstein–barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus (cmv)19,20, possibly due to reactive anti-hev igm antibodies generated by polyclonal activation of b-cells during acute human herpesviruses infections19,20. moreover, the elisa uses a selection of recombinant antigens with a determined conformation, which are not usually optimized, so these kits have high sensitivity but less specificity, resulting in an increase in the false positive rate4. however, this problem may be avoided by an immunoblot assay for the capture of igm specific for hev, since this assay tends to be more specific and thus can provide confirmation for the true positives4.the serological diagnosis of hev infection is not standardized, and commercially available assays show variability in specificity and sensitivity4. thus, the hev seroprevalence in the same cohort could vary when different assays are used, affecting the interpretation of the data. this fact makes it difficult to compare data from different studies based on the results of different assays5. in our study, we found that the seroprevalence of igm and igg antibodies against hev in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients was higher than previous reports in the general spanish population10,19,21,22, people living with hiv8,10,12,13, and other reports on hiv/hcv-coinfected patients8. and our seroprevalence data was higher even though most of the works did not include anti-hev antibody confirmation by immunoblot, which likely would have reduced their seroprevalence data further. the study of pineda et al. had a prevalence of 26% in hiv-infected patients, but this data was obtained without confirmation by immunoblot11. moreover, our prevalence data in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients were also higher than previous reports of european people living with hiv5.levels of cd4+ t-cells in peripheral blood seem to be the most widely associated risk factor for hev infection in hiv-infected patients6,23,24, although there are also articles that this association does not find25. the cd4+ t-cell counts reflect the level of immune suppression; and when cd4+ t-cells fall below 350 cells/μl, the risk of death, aids, and/or non-aids-defining conditions increases26,27,28,29. in our study, hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with cd4+ t-cells <350 cells/mm3 had a higher prevalence of anti-hev igg antibodies, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev than healthy controls and hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with cd4+ t-cells ≥350 cells/mm3. there is no clear explanation for this finding. one would think that subjects with cd4+ t-cells <350 cells/mm3 could have a worse immune response with lower titers of anti-hev igg antibodies, which could increase the false negative rate. however, we found higher seroprevalence of anti-hev igg antibodies in this subgroup of patients, which seems to indicate that cd4+ t-cells <350 cells/mm3 may predispose one to hev infection. moreover, this last explanation is not entirely clear since we found similar prevalence of anti-hev igm antibodies and acute hepatitis e in both groups of hiv/hcv-coinfected patients. regarding this, we should not forget the possibility of false positives for anti-hev igm antibodies due to other concomitant infections19,20, as discussed above.the detection of hev-rna is always recommended, but we did not find any sample with hev-rna in patients with anti-hev igm or igg antibodies. therefore, we could not confirm the hev replication in any patient with acute hepatitis e. we also did not find any patient with a possible chronic hepatitis e since no study subject had both anti-hev igg antibodies and hev-rna in plasma. a possible explanation for this data is the temporary viremia of short duration during acute hev infection with again time prior to the peak of antibodies against hev4. in fact, most of the epidemiological studies published have reported very low numbers of positive results for hev-rna and chronic hepatitis e in healthy donors5,25 and hiv-infected patients8,9,11,12,25. scotto et al. found a slightly higher frequency of chronic hepatitis hev was present in subjects co-infected with hcv25. despite this, hev-rna testing might offer an advantage in immunosuppressed patients with a worse antibody response to hev4, although our hiv/hcv-coinfected patients did not have severe immunosuppression (cd4+ counts <200 cells/mm3).finally, we did not find any significant association between hev seroprevalence and biomarkers of liver disease (lsm, liver stiffness, stages of liver fibrosis, and abnormal plasma liver enzymes), as previously suggested13,20.this could represent an added difficulty for the use of these markers for hiv/hcv-coinfected patients with hev infection.limitations of studyfirstly, this is a cross-sectional study with a limited number of patients in some of the study groups, which could result in a lack of uniformity and limit the possibility of finding significance. secondly, we may have introduced a selection bias since the selection of patients from gesida 3603b was done with set criteria for starting hcv treatment according to guidelines in 2012–2014(e.g., cd4+ cell counts >200 cells/mm3, controlled hiv replication, and proper treatment adherence). thirdly, this study was performed in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients and it would be also interesting to analyze a group of hcv-monoinfected patients as a control group to compare hev prevalences, but we did not have access to a cohort of hcv-monoinfected patients. besides, it lacked patients with decompensated cirrhosis to compare the hev prevalence with other fibrosis stages.conclusion sin conclusion , hiv/hcv-coinfected patients in spain had high prevalences of igg against hev, resolved hepatitis e, and exposure to hev as confirmed by immunoblot; in particular, patients with cd4+ t-cells <350 cells/mm3. our data suggest the need to increase hev surveillance to know the real magnitude of hev infection and its clinical implications in hiv/hcv-coinfected patients.patients and methodspatients and study designwe performed a cross-sectional study on 198 hiv/hcv-coinfected patients, from whom samples were collected from february 2012 to february 2014 from the cohort of “grupo de estudio del sida” (gesida 3603b study), and two control groups (30 healthy controls and 36 hiv-monoinfected patients). hiv/hcv-coinfected patients were candidates to start hcv therapy with peg-ifn-α/ribavirin or peg-ifn-α/ribavirin/direct-acting antivirals (daas) from 14 different institutions in spain (see appendix). a detailed description of the gesida 3603b study was previously reported15.the study was conducted according to the declaration of helsinki, and patients gave their written informed consent to participate. the study cohort received the approval of the ethics committees of the participating centers. the institutional review board and the committee for ethical research (cei) of the instituto de salud carlos iii (isciii) also approved the study.clinical datathe information of each patient was collected from medical records, as we have previously described15. all information was recorded using an online form in a shared database, which included all demographic, clinical, virological and laboratory data.a liver stiffness measurement (lsm) was performed by transient elastography (fibroscan®, echosens, paris, france), as we have previously described15. patients were stratified according to the following lsm cutoffs: <7.1 kpa (f0-f1), 7.1–9.4 kpa (f2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kpa (f3; advanced fibrosis), 12.5 to 25 kpa (non-risk of bleeding varices), 25 to 40 kpa (risk of bleeding varices), and >40 kpa (risk of hepatic decompensation).hev antibodies assaysplasma samples were collected at the spanish hiv hgm biobank and stored at −80 °c until use. samples were tested for hev antibodies (igm and igg) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using the abbia hev igm and abbia hev igg kits (ab diagnostic systems gmbh, germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions, on an eti-max 3000 instrument (diasorin, saluggia, italy). all samples positive in the elisa for igm and igg were subsequently confirmed using recomline hev igg/igm kit (mikrogen diagnostik, germany) using 20 µl per sample and following manufacturer’s instructions in an auto-lipa 48 device (innogenetics®, siemens healthcare diagnostic s.l.). we include a positive control (antibodies and rna-hev positives from an hev-infected patient) in order to confirm the correct performance of the techniques and hev detection.viral rna extractionall samples with anti-hev igm/igg antibodies were tested for hev-rna, which was extracted from 200 ml of plasma using a commercial dsp virus/pathogen mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) in the qiasymphony instrument(qiagen, hilden, germany) and stored until use at −80 °c.rt-pcr and nested for hev rna detectionall samples from patients with anti-hev igm/igg antibodies were tested for hev genome detection using a single-step retro-transcription and primary amplification with the rt-pcr one-step kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) followed by nested pcr. a total of 5 µl of viral rna extract was added to the rt-pcr mixture, which contained the following: 10 µl of 5x qiagen one-step rt-pcr buffer, 2 µl of dntps mix 10 mm, 0.25 µl of rnase inhibitor 0.2 u/µl, 3 µl forward primer hev1f 5′-ccaycagttymthaaggctc-3′ (10 µm) and reverse primer hev1r 5′-trccavcgctgracrtc-3′ (10 µm), 2 µl of qiagen one-step rt-pcr enzyme mix, and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 45 μl. all reagents except primers (sigma), and rnase inhibitor (roche) were supplied with the kit. amplification was programmed as follows: 30 min at 50 °c; 15 min at 95 °c; 40 repetitive cycles of 35 sec at 94 °c, 45 sec at 52 °c and 1 min at 72 °c; a final extension during 10 min at 72 °c.nested pcr was performed using 2 μl of the primary amplification product added to a mix containing 5 μl of 60% sucrose-0.08% cresol red, 5 μl of 10x pcr buffer 2w/15 mm mgcl2, 2 μl of 25 mm mgcl2, 1 μl of dntps 10 mm, 2 μl of each primer at 10 μm (orf1fn and orfirn, previously published19), 0.75 μl of expand hifi enzyme, and rnase free water up to 48 μl. all reagents except primers, 60% sucrose-0.08% cresol red and dntps were supplied with the roche expand high fidelity system kit (roche). the thermal conditions were 4 min at 94 °c; 30 repetitive cycles of 35 sec at 94 °c, 45 sec at 48 °c, 45 sec at 72 °c with a final extension of 5 min at 72 °c. negative and positive controls were included in all amplification procedures. pcr products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μl/ml of 10,000x sybr safe (invitrogen). positive samples showed a hev specific band size of ~172 bp. to avoid carryover contamination, standard precautions were taken. different biosafety cabinets were used for extraction, mixing, rt-pcr and nested pcr and pipetting was performed with aerosol-resistant tips. moreover, amplicons were detected in a different room.clinical outcomesthe clinical interpretation of hev screening was as follows: i) acute hepatitis e: a patient had acute hepatitis e when positive for anti-hev igm antibodies or both igm and igg, and/or hev-rna was detected; ii) resolved hepatitis e: a patient had resolved hepatitis e when only anti-hev igg antibodies were detected; and iii) exposure to hev: a patient was exposed to hev when acute or resolved hepatitis e was detected. this interpretation was made based on data confirmed by immunoblot since all patients positive for igm came out negative for viral detection.statistical analysisanalyses were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows, version 21.0 (ibm corp, armonk, ny, usa) and openepi (http://www.openepi.com/menu/oe_menu.htm)30. all p-values were two-tailed and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.for the descriptive study, values were expressed as absolute number (percentage) and median (25th; 75th percentile). categorical data and proportions were analyzed using the chi-squared test or fisher’s exact test. mann-whitney test was used to compare data among independent groups. the inter-rater agreement or concordance between serological techniques was measured by cohen’s kappa coefficient.

Mesenchymal stem cells are attracted to latent HIV-1-infected cells and enable virus reactivation via a non-canonical PI3K-NFκB signaling pathway,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32657-y,Research,2 October 2018,yes,"persistence of latent hiv-1 in macrophages (macs) and t-helper lymphocytes (thls) remain a major therapeutic challenge. currently available latency reversing agents (lras) are not very effective in vivo. therefore, understanding of physiologic mechanisms that dictate hiv-1 latency/reactivation in reservoirs is clearly needed. mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (mscs) regulate the function of immune cells; however, their role in regulating virus production from latently-infected macs & thls is not known. we documented that exposure to mscs or their conditioned media (msc-cm) rapidly increased hiv-1 p24 production from the latently-infected u1 (mac) & ach2 (thl) cell lines. exposure to mscs also increased hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) directed gene expression in the mac and thl reporter lines, u937-vrx and j-lat (9.2), respectively. mscs exposed to cm from u1 cells (u1-cm) showed enhanced migratory ability towards latently-infected cells and retained their latency-reactivation potential. molecular studies showed that msc-mediated latency-reactivation was dependent upon both the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (pi3k) and nuclear factor-κb (nfκb) signaling pathways. the pre-clinically tested inhibitors of pi3k (px-866) and nfκb (cddo-me) suppressed msc-mediated hiv-1 reactivation. furthermore, coexposure to msc-cm enhanced the latency-reactivation efficacy of the approved lras, vorinostat and panobinostat. our findings on msc-mediated latency-reactivation may provide novel strategies against persistent hiv-1 reservoirs.
introduction the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) has become an adversary of alarming proportions, with more than 39 million deaths worldwide1,2. approximately 37 million individuals are currently living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) and more than two million people are newly infected annually2. although the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) has been very effective in suppressing plasma viral load (pvl)3, hiv-1 persistence in latent tissue reservoirs remains a significant challenge to long-term cure4,5. in these sequestered anatomical reservoirs, low chronic level of virus production and continuous release of viral factors can occur, which facilitate both disease progression and therapeutic resistance. therefore, substantial efforts are underway to either utilize a ‘shock’ approach towards continuous reactivation and depletion of the latently-infected cells or to target the host cell signaling pathways that enable an effective ‘lock’ of virus reactivation from reservoirs, and thus, enhance the efficacy of haart6,7,8. indeed, several latency reversing agents (lras) are being tested clinically that either activate nfκb through protein kinase-c (pkc) signaling pathway or enable epigenetic activation of the hiv-1 provirus using the histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci)6,7. however, the pkc-inducing lras, e.g. prostratin, have shown significant side-effects and the hdaci lras, e.g. panobinostat, have not been very effective in vivo8. therefore, a better understanding of host factors and/or physiologic signaling pathways that regulate latency and/or reactivation within tissue hiv-1 reservoirs may facilitate the discovery of safer and more effective therapeutic strategies in hiv-positive patients9,10.hiv-1 preferentially infects cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages, e.g. t-helper lymphocytes (thls) and monocytes-derived macrophages (macs), where the virus integrates into host cell chromosome to form the provirus11. transcriptional activation of this latent provirus is primarily regulated by both viral proteins (e.g. tat and nef) and host-cell transcription factors (e.g. nfκb and nfat) that recognize specific sequences within the hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr). interestingly however, molecular studies on proviral latency and/or reactivation have mostly focused on the latently-infected thls (memory phenotype)4,12,13 despite the fact that numerous studies demonstrate a crucial role of latently-infected macs14,15. indeed, macs constitute the earliest targets for infection by the ccr5-tropic hiv-116. furthermore, due to their ability to transmigrate into tissue compartments, macs are implicated in viral dissemination to multiple anatomical sites17,18. the hiv-1-infected macs play a predominant role in regulating viral load in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (galt)19. additionally, in the central nervous system (cns), perivascular macs (a.k.a. microglial cells) are a major hiv-1 producing cell20,21. both cell-to-cell and/or cell-to-stroma interactions can regulate immune activation22,23 and immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (mscs) are now well accepted24,25,26. indeed, exposure to msc-secretome was shown to alter the m1 or m2 polarization of macrophages25. since mscs are present in all known hiv-1 reservoirs, such as lymph nodes, bone marrow, brain, gut and adipose tissue27,28, the role of mscs in regulating viral latency and/or reactivation would be of crucial significance.our in vitro investigations demonstrated that exposure to conditioned medium (cm) from mscs (msc-cm) caused a rapid increase in virus production from two latently infected cell line models, i.e. u1 (monocytic) and ach2 (t-cell). mscs showed the ability to migrate towards both u1 and ach2 cells, and msc with enhanced migratory ability also retained their latency-reactivation potential. molecular mechanistic studies clearly showed that virus reactivation by msc-secreted factors occurred due to the activation of hiv-1 ltr directed gene expression. we documented that msc-secreted factors activate hiv-1 via a non-canonical signal transduction pathway, which was pi3k- and nfκb-dependent, but akt-independent. several clinically tested inhibitors of pi3k (e.g. px-866) and nfκb, (e.g. cddo-me) were able to suppress this msc-mediated latency-reactivation. most importantly, costimulation with msc-cm significantly enhanced the latency-reactivation ability of the clinically approved lra, panobinostat. our findings on msc-mediated reactivation of latent hiv-1 may provide novel strategies to eliminate the persistent viral reservoirs in patients.resultsexposure to asc-secreted factors enabled hiv-1 reactivation from u1 cellswe compared the effect of adipose-derived mscs (ascs) and differentiated adipocytes (ads) on virus production from latently-infected u1 monocytic cells, by measuring hiv-1 p24 levels in culture supernatants (fig. 1). a representative image of ascs (top) and oil red-o stained adipocytes (bottom) are shown in fig. 1a. culture conditioned medium (cm) were collected from these ascs (asc-cm) and adipocytes (ad-cm) and were then added to u1 cells at a 50% dilution. bar graphs in fig. 1b show hiv-1 p24 production by these u1 cells, following 3-, 5- and 7-days post-exposure to either asc-cm or ad-cm. u1 growth media (u1-cont.), asc growth media (asc-cont.) and adipocyte differentiation media (ad-cont.) were used as controls. exposure to u1-cont., asc-cont. or ad-cont. media did not significantly alter hiv-1 production from u1 cells. however, exposure to asc-cm or ad-cm caused a rapid and potent increase in hiv-1 p24 levels. interestingly, asc-cm caused a 6–10 fold higher hiv-1 p24 production by u1 cells as compared to those exposed to ad-cm. this indicated a crucial role of factors secreted by stem cells, and not differentiated adipocytes, in latency-reactivation. next, we compared the effect of exposure to pma (10 ng/ml) and/or asc-cm (10% and 25%) on hiv-1 reactivation from u1 cells (fig. 1c). results showed that asc-cm was as potent as pma in increasing hiv-1 p24 production and coexposure to asc-cm enhanced the latency reactivation efficacy of pma. these observations suggest the therapeutic potential of asc-cm when combined with current lras.figure 1effect of factors secreted by ascs and adipocytes on hiv-1 p24 production by u1 cells and hiv-1 ltr function in u-494 cells. (a) representative images of unstained ascs (top) and oil red-o stained adipocytes (bottom). adipocyte differentiation was clearly evident. (b) elisa data on hiv-1 p24 production (pg/ml) by u1 cells exposed to conditioned media (cm) from either ascs (asc-cm) or adipocytes (ad-cm). both u1 growth media (u1-cont.), asc growth media (asc-cont.) and adipocyte differentiation media (ad-cont.) were used as controls. asc-cm enabled a more rapid and potent latency-reactivation compared to ad-cm. (c) comparative analysis of hiv-1 p24 levels following exposure of u1 cells to either asc-cm (10% and 25%) or pma (10 ng/ml). the asc secreted factors were as potent as pma in latency reactivation. (d) a schematic of the vrx494 lentivirus (lv) which expresses green fluorescent protein (gfp) under the transcriptional control of hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr). in (e–h), the u-494 cells, which were u937 cells stably transduced with lv vrx494, were used to measure hiv-1 ltr directed gfp expression. (e) mean fluorescence intensities (mean fitc-a) of gfp expression by u-494 cells exposed to either asc-cm or ad-cm are shown. (f) representative photomicrograph of gfp positive u-494 cells, both unstimulated and following exposure to asc-cm (25% or 50%). (g) representative flow cytometry panels of increased mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of the gfp-positive (p2 area) u937 cells (as control) and in both unstimulated and asc-cm (25% or 50%) stimulated u-494 cells. (h) mfis (n = 3) of gfp expression by u-494 cells under unstimulated and asc-cm (25% or 50%) stimulated conditions. error bars show ±sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001). exposure to asc-cm increased both hiv-1 reactivation in u1 cells and hiv-1 ltr function in u-494 cells.full size imageexposure to asc-cm increased hiv-1 ltr directed reporter gene expressionwe investigated whether latency-reactivation by asc-cm occurs due to increased hiv-1 ltr directed gene expression. studies were carried out using the u-494 cells, which were generated by stably transducing the u937 cell line with the lentivirus vrx-494 (fig. 1d). this u-494 model enabled flow cytometric analysis of hiv-1 ltr function by measuring green fluorescent protein (gfp) expression after for 48 h of exposure to cms. exposure to asc-cont. or ad-cont. media did not increase hiv-1 ltr activity. however, as compared to ad-cm, exposure to asc-cm showed significantly (p < 0.01) higher ltr-directed gfp expression by the u-494 cells (fig. 1e). furthermore, exposure to increasing concentrations of asc-cm (25% and 50%) showed a dose-dependent enhancement in the (a) number (fig. 1f), (b) percentage (fig. 1g) and (c) mean fluorescence intensities (mfi) of gfp-positive cells (fig. 1h). therefore, factors secreted by ascs, can increase hiv-1 ltr-directed gene expression. these findings indicated that the latency-reactivation by the asc-secreted factors may be due to increased ltr-directed transcription of the latent provirus.latency-reactivation was corroborated using mscs from both adipose-tissue (ascs) and bone-marrow (bmscs) obtained from multiple donorsto fully corroborate the latency-reactivation potential of mscs, we used stem cells obtained from eight more batches of adipose-derived mscs (ascs) and two different batches of bone-derived mscs (bmsc) (fig. 2). experiments were carried out using both cm from mscs (fig. 2a–f) and following coculture with mscs (fig. 2g,h). a rapid increase in hiv-1 p24 production from u1 cells was clearly documented following exposure to factors secreted from ascs (asc-1 to asc-7) and bmscs (bmsc-1 and −2) (fig. 2a–f). u1 cells that were exposed to control medium did not increase hiv-1 p24 production (solid black bars); however, in all cases, exposure to asc-cm or bmsc-cm significantly increased hiv-1 p24 production within 3-days, which was further augmented at 5- and 7-days post-exposure. next, we wanted to determine whether the coculturing of ascs with u1 cells can similarly activate hiv-1 from latency. indeed, using another more batche of ascs (asc-8) we confirmed the inductive effects of asc coculture on u1 cells (fig. 2g,h). studies carried out at different u1:asc cell coculture ratios (1:5 or 1:1) clearly showed that even low number of ascs enable potent hiv-1 reactivation from u1 cells at 3-, 5- and 7-days post coculture. therefore, both direct interaction between ascs and u1 cells (coculture) and/or exposure to msc-secreted factors (cm) are effective in latency reactivation. in addition, the latency-reactivation potential of mscs may be a general phenomenon observed with stem cells from multiple donors.figure 2latency-reactivation of u1 cells using both ascs and bmscs and in multiple donor batches. in (a–d), effect of cm from seven (7) different batches of adipose-tissue derived ascs (asc-1 to asc-7). in (e,f), effect of cm from two (2) different batches of bone-marrow derived mscs (bmsc) is shown. the latently-infected u1 cells were exposed to 50% asc-cm or bmsc-cm and culture supernatants were collected after 3–7 days post-exposure to measure hiv-1 p24 levels by elisa (pg/ml). u1 cells exposed to growth media only were used as background controls (cont.). as compared to control media (black bars) u1 cells exposed to asc-cm or bmsc-cm showed significant increases in hiv-1 p24 (gray bars). in (g,h), effect of asc coculture with u1 cells is shown. for these studies, an eighth donor batch of ascs (asc-8) were co-cultured with u1 cells at different u1:asc coculture ratios, either 1:5 (g) or 1:1 (h). supernatants from u1 only cultures were used as control hiv-1 p24 values (black bars) and compared to culture supernatants after 3–7 days following asc coculture (gray bars). error bars show ± sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001). potent latency-reactivation of u1 cells was corroborated using multiple asc and bmsc batches, and using both cm and coculture experiments.full size imageexposure to factors secreted by latently-infected u1 cells were able to increase the migration and homing ability of ascsstudies were carried out to measure the effect of cm from u1 cells (u1-cm) on both asc motility (fig. 3a,b) and asc homing (fig. 3c,d), by using wound-heal assays and transwell migration assays, respectively. as compared to ascs that were exposed to either serum free media (sfm) or factors secreted from uninfected u937 cells (u937-cm), exposure to the factors secreted from u1 cells (u1-cm) was able to significantly (p < 0.001) augment the migration of ascs, as evident by decrease in wound width at 48 h post-exposure (fig. 3a). we documented a significant decrease in the percent wound closure by ascs following their exposure to u1-cm, as compared to sfm or u937-cm (fig. 3b). next, transwell migration assays were employed to investigate the effect of u1-cm on the attraction (homing) of ascs towards the u1 cells (fig. 3c). for these studies, ascs were cultured in the top chamber of transwell plates and their migration to the bottom chamber was measured after 24 h. light microscope images of ascs attached to the bottom of the membrane inserts also indicated an activated phenotype of asc that were exposed to u1-cm, as observed by the clustering of cells and their morphology. as compared to ascs that transmigrated in response to sfm or u937-cm, exposure to u1-cm showed significantly (p < 0.0001) higher homing ability of ascs (fig. 3d). these findings clearly indicated that ascs are attracted to factors secreted by the latently-infected u1 cells.figure 3effect of u1-secreted factor(s) on migration, homing and latency-reactivation potential of ascs. (a,b) changes in asc motility following exposure to 50% cm from either u937 or u1 cell (u937-cm and u1-cm, respectively), were measured by scratch-wound assays. effect of serum free media (sfm) was used as control. (a) a representative image (10x magnification) of wounds at the initial time point (0 h) and at 48 h post-treatment. (b) percent change in wound widths (closure) are shown in bar graphs (n = 3). exposure to factors secreted by u1 cells increased the migratory ability of ascs. (c,d) homing ability of ascs towards either u937-cm or u1-cm was measured by transwell migration assays. (c) a representative image (10x) of ascs attached to the bottom of transwell inserts (8 μm pore size). (d) differences in the number of ascs migrating in response to either sfm (control) or towards cms from u937 or u1 cells, are shown in the bar graphs (n = 3). exposure to factors secreted by u1 cells increased the homing ability of ascs. in (e,f), a comparative analysis of homing ability (e) and latency-reactivation potential (f) of both the non-migratory ascs (nmasc) and migratory ascs (masc) are shown. the nmasc and masc were harvested from the top and bottom chambers, respectively. each batch of ascs was further propagated and cm collected from both subpopulations. (e) shows differences in the homing ability of nmmscs and mmscs towards u1-cm. (f) shows differences in the latency-reactivation potential of nmasc-cm and masc-cm on u1 cells. the mascs showed higher homing ability and retained their latency-reactivation potential. error bars show ± sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001).full size imagethe enriched migratory ascs retained their reservoir cell-tropism and their latency-reactivation potentialfollowing the transwell migration of ascs in response to u1-cm, these ascs were harvested from both the upper and lower chambers to obtain the non-migratory ascs (nmasc) and migratory ascs (masc), respectively. in subsequent transmigration assays, using both nmascs and mascs, we documented that the migration of mascs towards the latently-infected u1-cm was 6–8 fold higher than the nmascs (p < 0.0001) (fig. 3e). thus, findings showed that the mascs retained their homing phenotype towards u1-cm. next, we tested the hiv-1 reactivation potential of both nmascs and mascs. thus, similar to the factors secreted by nmascs (nmasc-cm), the masc-cm was also able to increase virus production from u1 cells (fig. 3f). thus, ascs possessing higher homing ability and latency-reactivation potential may be exploited towards a target reactivation of the latent hiv-1 reservoirs.ascs are not productively infected but secrete factors that enable constant latency-reactivation of the u1 cellswe previously documented that chronic exposure to hiv-1 (htlv iiib strain) enable latent infection of both bmscs29 and ascs30 and enabled the uptake of hiv-1 tat protein by these cells. therefore, here we wanted to first investigate whether acute exposure to hiv-1 (u1 strain) enables asc infection and/or uptake of hiv-1 tat protein, as well (fig. 4). for these studies, ascs were exposed to high titer virus (moi = 10) from productively infected u1 cells (pma stimulated). next day, cells were thoroughly washed to remove any residual virus, cultured for 3–7 days, and supernatants were assessed for hiv-1 p24 production. in the unstimulated u1 cells, low level virus production (<200 pg/ml) was detected within 3-days, indicating their latent infection. however, in ascs, exposure to hiv-1 did not show any detectable hiv-1 p24 production even after 7-days post-exposure (fig. 4a). thus, ascs themselves are not susceptible to productive infection, and the rapid increase in hiv-1 following a single exposure to high dose asc-cm (50%) may be primarily due to virus production from the u1 cells only. therefore, next, we wanted to determine whether chronic exposure to factors secreted from a low number of ascs is sufficient in increasing latency reactivation in u1 cells (fig. 4b). this was tested using a transwell coculture chamber containing a 0.4 μm pore insert, which enabled the transfer of media components only, but no cells transmigrated. the ascs were cultured on the top chamber and u1 cells were cultured in the bottom chamber of transwell plates (fig. 4b, top). results showed that the asc-secreted soluble factors are able to reactivate hiv-1 from u1 cells, and this was clearly evident after 3-, 5- and 7-days post transwell coculture (fig. 4b, bottom). thus, soluble factors from ascs enable productive infection in the latently infected u1 cells.figure 4cell-to-cell interactions between ascs and u1, and its effects on the latency-reactivation potential of ascs. (a) hiv-1 p24 production by ascs exposed to high titer hiv-1 (maximum moi = 10). unstimulated u1 cells were used as controls. no detectable hiv-1 p24 was seen in culture supernatants from hiv-1 exposed ascs. (b) coculture assays using transwell chambers containing 0.4 μm membrane inserts enabled the monitoring of u1 reactivation following chronic exposure to asc-secreted factors. ascs were culture in upper chamber and u1 cells were cultured in the lower chamber (top panel). culture media from the bottom chamber were collected after 3–7 days to measure hiv-1 p24 levels (pg/ml). a direct contact between both cell types is not necessary for asc-mediated hiv-1 reactivation from u1 cells. (c) a representative photomicrograph of u1 cells alone (left) and u1 + asc cocultures (right). following 7-days of coculture, u1 cells preferentially adhered to the underlying ascs. (d) immunodetection of hiv-1 tat protein in ascs exposed to cm from pma-stimulated u1 cells (left) and in direct coculture of ascs with u1 cells (right). merged images show tat-specific staining (green) and dapi-stained nuclei (blue). the tat protein, secreted from u1 cells, is efficiently internalized by ascs. (e) effect of pma-stimulation on asc-mediated latency reactivation of u1 cells grown in direct contact with ascs. compared to unstimulated u1 cultures (black bars) the pma-stimulated u1 cells showed increases in hiv-1 p24 levels (gray bars) which were significantly increased in asc + u1 cocultures (white bars). (f) effect of pre-exposure to u1-cm on the latency-reactivation ability of ascs. for these studies, asc-cms were collected from both untreated ascs (asc-cm1) and from ascs that were pre-primed by u1-cm (asc-cm2). the latency-reactivation potential of both asc-cm1 and asc-cm2 were compared. error bars show ±sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.0001). asc interactions with u1 cells enable the uptake of tat protein and ascs pre-primed by u1-cm have increased latency-reactivation ability.full size imageu1 cells cocultured with ascs enabled the transfer of hiv-1 tat protein and activated ascs showed higher latency-reactivation abilitytat protein is secreted by hiv-1 infected cells, and its uptake can activate signaling in neighboring uninfected cells31,32. direct coculture experiments showed that the latently-infected u1 cells interact closely with ascs (fig. 4c) and this enabled the transfer of tat protein from u1 cells to the ascs (fig. 4d). images show that, when cultured without ascs, these u1 cells grew as individual floating cells (fig. 4c, left panel). however, following 7-days of coculture with ascs, these u1 cells were attached to the underlying ascs and grew in clusters (fig. 4c, right). in subsequent experiments, immunofluorescence microscopy (ifm) of ascs, that were either exposed to cm from pma-stimulated u1 cells (fig. 4d, left) or co-cultured with unstimulated u1 cells (fig. 4d, right) clearly showed tat-specific immunostaining (green) in ascs exposed to pma-activated u1-cm. in addition, tat protein was detected in both the asc-activated u1 cells and in the u1-associated ascs. therefore, we measured virus production by u1 cells following their direct coculture with ascs (1:1 cell ratio) (fig. 4e). similar to the effect of asc-cm, direct contact with ascs increased hiv-1 p24 production at 3, 5 and 7 days post coculture. most interestingly, similar to the data obtained with asc-cm and pma costimulation, we observed a significantly (p < 0.001) higher latency-reactivation when the u1:asc cocultures were also exposed to pma. thus, both ascs and u1 cells are activated within inflammatory microenvironments to enable significant latency-reactivation. next, we investigated whether the latency-reactivation ability of ascs can be increased following their exposure to factors from u1 cells (fig. 4f). for these studies, cms were collected from both unstimulated ascs (asc-cm1) and from ascs that were pre-stimulated with u1-cm (asc-cm2). we compared the effect of asc-cm1 and asc-cm2 on hiv-1 p24 production by the u1 cells. results clearly showed that the ascs that were pre-stimulated with u1-cm secreted factors that enabled significantly higher latency-reactivation (p < 0.05).latency-reactivation by mscs was corroborated in two t-cell line models of hiv-1 latencywe investigated whether mscs can reactivate the hiv-1 provirus in other latently infected cells by using two well-established t-cell line models, i.e. ach2 and j-lat(9.2) (fig. 5). exposure to cm from ascs (asc-cm) or bmscs (bmsc-cm) caused a temporal increase in hiv-1 p24 production in ach2 cell cultures (fig. 5a). this latency-reactivation was further confirmed by western immunoblot (ib), where increased expression of hiv-1 nef protein was clearly evident in lysates from asc exposed ach2 cells (fig. 5b). next, we measured the effect of asc coculture with ach2 cells (fig. 5c,d). similar to the u1 cells, coculture studies showed that the ach2 cells directly interacted with ascs (fig. 5c) and significantly higher hiv-1 p24 production was documented when ach2 cells were cocultured with ascs (fig. 5d). in subsequent studies, asc-mediated latency reactivation was also investigated using the j-lat (9.2) cell line. in these cells, a gfp open reading frame (orf) had been inserted within the env gene, which enables a direct measurement of ltr-directed provirus reactivation by gfp fluorescence. in coculture experiments, we observed that the j-lat (9.2) cells strongly attached to the ascs (fig. 5e) and this enabled significant increases in reporter expression, as evident by increases in both gfp fluorescence (fig. 5f) and fold increase in gfp-positive cells (fig. 5g). thus, findings using both u1 and ach2 latency models clearly demonstrated that the latency-reactivation potential of ascs is a phenomenon associated with both monocytic and t-cells. in addition, findings using u937-vrx and j-lat (9.2) models implicated a crucial role for asc-secreted factors in activating the latent provirus and hiv-1 ltr directed gene expression. therefore, subsequent studies were carried out to investigate: (a) the therapeutic potential of asc-cm in combination with lras; (b) the molecular mechanism(s) associated with latency-reactivation.figure 5effect of msc-secreted factors on hiv-1 reactivation from t-cells. we investigated whether mscs can reactivate hiv-1 using two well-established t-cell line models, i.e. ach2 and j-lat (9.2). (a) effect of exposure to asc-cm or bmsc-cm on virus reactivation from ach2 cells. as compared to unstimulated ach2 cells (black bars) exposure to 50% cm from both ascs (gray bars) and bmscs (white bars) increased hiv-1 p24 production (pg/ml) at 3, 5 and 7-days. (b) western immunoblot analysis of lysates from the ach2 cells cocultured with ascs was further confirmed hiv-1 activation, where increased expression of hiv-1 nef protein was clearly evident. relative band intensity (presented the numbers to the corresponding lanes) was compared by the image-j software (version 1.50). (c) a representative image of ascs cocultured with ach2 cells. following 7-days of coculture, unlike the ach2 cultures alone (left) the cocultured ach2 cells preferentially adhered to the underlying ascs (right). (d) as compared to ach2 cells alone, significantly higher hiv-1 p24 production was observed when ach2 cells were cocultured with ascs. (e) asc-mediated latency reactivation was investigated using the j-lat (9.2) cell line, which expresses gfp from an integrated hiv-1 provirus. in coculture experiments, the j-lat (9.2) cells were found to directly interact with ascs (right) as compared to themselves (left). (f) a representative image of gfp expression in j-lat (9.2) cells, alone (left) or following asc coculture (right). (g) fold change in gfp-positive j-lat (9.2) cells, in the absence or presence of ascs. error bars show ±sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001). the latency-reactivation potential of ascs was corroborated using two established t-cell line models of hiv-1 latency.full size imagecoexposure to asc-cm enhanced the latency-reactivation ability of panobinostatseveral class-i hdac inhibitors, such as vorinostat and panobinostat, are being clinically tested as epigenetic activators of the latent hiv-1 provirus33,34. however, studies have also questioned their efficacy in hiv-1 reservoirs in vivo35,36. therefore, recent publications have underscored the need for using different combinations of lras to enable potent latency-reactivation37,38. we investigated whether coexposure to the asc-cm can increase the lra efficacy of vorinostat (saha) and panobinostat (pano) (fig. 6). at physiologically achievable concentrations of panobinostat (10 nm) or vorinostat (300 nm) we observed only a 2–3 fold increase in hiv-1 p24 production from u1 cells (fig. 6a, bottom panel) and no detectable increase in hiv-1 nef protein was observed (fig. 6a, top panel). however, exposure to asc-cm (25%) showed a 20–25 fold increase in both hiv-1 p24 production (fig. 6a, bottom panel) and clearly increased nef protein expression in the u1 cells (fig. 6a, top panel). findings demonstrated that, as compared to either vorinostat or panobinostat, factors secreted by ascs are significantly more effective in latency-reactivation. next, we investigated whether costimulation with asc-cm can increase the lra efficacy of panobinostat. indeed, compared to increasing doses of panobinostat alone (pano; 2.5–10 nm) coexposure to asc-cm (25%) enabled significantly higher hiv-1 p24 production from u1 cells (fig. 6b). furthermore, coexposure to increasing doses of asc-cm (10–50%) enabled significantly higher hiv-1 p24 production from u1 cells that were treated with panobinostat (10 nm) (fig. 6c). since our previous findings using the asc subpopulation which preferentially migrated to u1 cells (mascs) showed their latency-reactivation potential, we wanted to investigate whether masc-cm can also increase the therapeutic potential of panobinostat. similar to nmasc-cm, costimulation with masc-cm (25%) significantly enhanced the lra efficacy of panobinostat (10 nm) (fig. 6d). above findings implicated the therapeutic potential of reservoir-tropic ascs in increasing the efficacy of clinically approved lra drugs such as panobinostat.figure 6effect of asc-cm on latency-reactivation efficacy of panobinostat. (a) effect of exposure to asc-cm (25% or 50%) or hdaci [saha or panobinostat(pano)] on hiv-1 nef protein expression (top panels) and hiv-1 p24 production (bottom panels) by the u1 cells. relative western blot band intensity (presented the numbers to the corresponding lanes on the top panel) was compared by the image-j software (version 1.50). the asc-cm mediated latency reactivation was much more potent, as compared to saha (300 nm) or panobinostat (10 nm). (b) effect of asc-cm (25%) coexposure on panobinostat (2.5–10 nm) mediated increases in hiv-1 p24 production by u1 cells. coexposure to asc-cm increased the latency-reactivation efficacy of panobinostat. (c) effect of increasing concentrations of asc-cm (10–50%) on panobinostat (10 nm) induced latency-reactivation. coexposure to even low concentrations of asc-cm increased latency-reactivation by panobinostat. (d) effect of cm, from either non-migratory or migratory ascs (nmascs and mascs, respectively) on latency-reactivation by panobinostat (10 nm). the mascs retain their ability to activate hiv-1 p24 from u1 cells and secrete factors that augment the efficacy of panobinostat. error bars show ± sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001). coexposure to asc-secreted factors potentiate the efficacy of a clinically approved hdaci, i.e. panobinostat (pano).full size imageasc-mediated latency-reactivation in u1 cells may exploit a non-canonical pi3k-nfκb signaling pathwayby using specific signal transduction inhibitors, we carried out studies to delineate the signaling pathways involved in asc-mediated latency-reactivation in u1 cells (fig. 7). the nf-κb transcription factor is a primary mechanism of hiv-1 reactivation from latency. therefore, we first tested whether pre-exposure to a potent nf-κb inhibitor, cddo-me (bardoxolone-methyl; bm) can suppress hiv-1 p24 production from u1 cells, which were stimulated with either pma (10 ng/ml) or asc-cm (50%) (fig. 7a). nf-κb inhibition suppressed pma-stimulated hiv-1 p24 production by more than 50% (p < 0.001) but only suppressed asc-mediated inductive effects by approximately 25%. thus, factors secreted by ascs (asc-cm) may utilize signaling mechanisms other than nfκb to activate viral latency in u1 cells. therefore, we tested the effects of two pi3k pathway inhibitors, ly294002 and px-866. pre-exposure to ly294002 (10 μm) suppressed the inductive effects of asc-cm by more than 70% (p < 0.0001) (fig. 7b). importantly, a more potent and clinically tested pi3k inhibitor, px-866 was also effective in decreasing asc-cm-mediated effects. as much as a 70–85% decrease in asc-cm induced hiv-1 p24 production was observed even with a very low dose of px-866 (500 nm) (fig. 7c). therefore, finding indicated a role for both pi3k and nfκb signaling pathways in regulating the asc-cm mediated latency-reactivation.figure 7role of nf-κb, pi3k and akt pathways in asc-mediated latency-reactivation of u1 cells. (a) effect of nf-κb inhibitor, bardoxolone-methyl (bm; a.k.a. cddo-me) on hiv-1 p24 production by u1 cells, stimulated with either asc-cm (50%) or pma (10 ng/ml). exposure to bm (50 nm) decreased hiv-1 p24 production in both pma-induced and asc-cm-stimulated u1 cells. (b,c) effect of pi3k inhibitors, (b) ly294002 (10 μm) or (c) px866 (500 nm) on hiv-1 p24 production in asc-cm (50%) stimulated u1 cells. pi3k inhibitors suppressed latency-reactivation by asc-cm. (d,e) effects of akt inhibition by 124005 (5 μm) and akt activation by sc-79 (2.5 μm) on asc-cm (50%) induced hiv-1 p24 production. latency-reactivation by asc-cm is increased following akt inhibition and decreased following akt induction. (f) effect of heat-inactivation (hi) of asc-cm or bmsc-cm on hiv-1 ltr-directed gfp expression (mfi) by the u-494 cells. heat labile factors in cms are responsible for ltr activation. (g) effect of pi3k and nf-κb inhibitors on hiv-1 ltr function in u-494 cells, stimulated with either asc-cm (50%) or pma (10 ng/ml). gfp expression (mfi) was monitored after 48 h and fold change (compared to control media) are shown. both ly294002 (pi3k inhibitor) and bm (nfκb inhibitor) suppressed hiv-1 ltr function, but 124005 (akt inhibitor) showed an inductive effect. error bars show ± sem and significant changes are represented as p-values (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001). (h) immunoblot (ib) analysis of hiv-1 nef, pi3k(p110β), and phosphorylated akt [pakt(473)] and nfκb [pnfκbp65] proteins in unstimulated and asc-cm (50%) stimulated u1 cells. gapdh was used as a loading control. exposure to asc-cm causes temporal increases (3–7 days) in pi3k, nfκb and akt activation, and augments hiv-1 nef expression. effects of ly294002 (i), 124005 (j) and bm (k) on asc-cm (50%) stimulated hiv-1 nef, pi3k(p110β), and both total & activated forms of akt and nfκbp65 proteins at 24 h post-stimulation. exposure to inhibitors suppressed pi3k(p110β), pnfκbp65 and pakt(s473) levels. hiv-1 nef in asc-cm treated u1 cells was also decreased following exposure to signal transduction inhibitors. relative band intensity (presented the numbers to the corresponding lanes) was compared by the image-j software (version 1.50). the nf-kb, pi3k and akt pathways play crucial roles in regulating hiv-1 reactivation in u1 cells and hiv-1 ltr activation in u-494 cells.full size imagethe pi3k signaling cascade activates the downstream akt pathway39. therefore, we investigated the effects of akt-inhibition (fig. 7d) or akt-induction (fig. 7e) on asc-cm mediated latency-reactivation. surprisingly, in contrast to the potent suppressive effects of the pi3k inhibitors (ly294002 & px-866), pretreatment of u1 cells with the akt-inhibitor, 124005 significantly increased hiv-1 p24 production (fig. 7d). furthermore, the akt-inducer, sc-79 significantly decreased hiv-1 p24 production (fig. 7e). therefore, although the pi3k pathway is associated with latency-reactivation, the downstream akt pathway may have a suppressive effect. thus, ascs reactivate hiv-1 from u1 cells via a non-canonical pi3k and nfκb dependent mechanism, which is negatively affected by akt.asc-mediated increases in hiv-1 ltr function in u-494 cells occurred via a pi3k & nfκb-dependent mechanismwe investigated whether the hiv-1 inductive effects of ascs occur due to hiv-1 ltr activation via the pi3k and nkκb signaling pathways. studies were carried out using the ltr-gfp reporter cell line, u-494 (fig. 7f,g). exposure to control msc-cm, either asc-cm or bmsc-cm, were able to increase hiv-1 ltr directed gfp expression; however, exposure to the heat-inactivated (hi) asc-cm or bmsc-cm did not increase ltr function (fig. 7f). therefore, heat-labile soluble factors were found to be responsible for increased ltr function. next, we used different signal transduction inhibitors and assessed their ability to suppress gfp levels in u-494 cells (fig. 7g). increased hiv-1 ltr function, seen with both asc-cm and pma stimulation, was inhibited by the nfκb inhibitor cddo-me (bm; 50 nm) and the pi3k inhibitor, ly294002 (10 μm). interestingly however, exposure to the akt-inhibitor (124005; 5 μm) did not significantly increase hiv-1 ltr function. thus, similar to the activation of infectious hiv-1 in u1 cells, the activation of hiv-1 ltr in u-494 cells require the activation of both pi3k and nfκb pathways.pi3k(p110β) and nfκb(p65) activation correlated with asm-cm mediated latency-reactivation and increased hiv-1 nef protein levelsto measure the activation of above signaling pathways, we carried out western immunoblot analysis of pi3k(p110β) and both total and phosphorylated forms of akt (s473) and nfκb(p65) proteins using lysates from both unstimulated and asc-cm- stimulated u1 cells. in cells that were exposed to asc-cm (50%) for 3, 5 and 7 days, we observed that hiv-1 nef protein levels are increased within 3-days post-exposure to asc-cm and nef levels were further enhanced at 5 and 7 days (fig. 7h). similarly, we observed temporal increases in pi3k(p110β), pakt(s473) and pnfκb(p65) in the asc-cm-stimulated u1 cells. both pi3k(p110β) and pakt levels were significantly higher at the 3-day and 5-day time points and showed a slight decrease at the 7-day time point. increased pnfκb(p65) levels were also clearly evident. this indicated that the above three signaling pathways are activated in u1 cells and may be directly involved in latency-reactivation, and increased hiv-1 nef protein expression. next, we tested whether specific inhibitors of these three signaling pathways can suppress asc-cm stimulated nef expression (fig. 7i–k). for these experiments, u1 cells were pre-exposed to the inhibitors for 2 h prior to their stimulation with asc-cm (50%) and cells were harvested after 24 h. western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that hiv-1 nef levels were significantly increased following 24 h of asc-cm exposure. although pi3k(p110β) was increased at the later time points, a similar increase in pi3k(p110β) was not seen after 24 h stimulation (fig. 7i). however, both pakt(s473) (fig. 7j) and pnfκb(p65) (fig. 7k) levels were detectably increased and slight increases in total akt and pnfκbp65 were also seen at this time point. in addition, ib studies using cells pre-exposed to the akt-inhibitor, 124005 (5 μm) or the nfκb inhibitor, bm (100 nm) clearly showed the specificity of these inhibitors. both pakt(s473) (fig. 7j) and pnfκb(p65) (fig. 7k) levels were decreased, and these inhibitors were able to suppress the asc-cm mediated increase in hiv-1 nef expression. most interestingly, even low dose (100 nm) of bm was sufficient in suppressing nef protein activation. above ib studies confirmed that exposure to asc-cm activates pi3k, akt and nfκb signaling pathways, and a cross-talk between these pathways may be involved in regulating latency and/or reactivation of hiv-1 in the u1 cells.discussion in hiv-1 positive patients on haart, low level viral replication continues to occur within tissue hiv-1 reservoirs, where subtherapeutic drug concentrations facilitate the selection of resistant mutants4,5. the confirmation of active virus production from latent reservoirs was first documented by chun et al., (2000) where they showed that the genotype of virus that rebounds following haart discontinuation are distinct from those present in the blood40. indeed, prompt viral rebound from reservoirs further corroborates that low-level viral replication continues to occur despite haart4,7. multiple studies have shown that latently-infected cells are major players in hiv-1 persistence, propagation and dissemination16,41,42,43. however, systemic haart is primarily focused on decreasing plasma viral load and does not target the latently-infected cells in anatomical reservoirs12,17,33,35. factors that critically regulate latency and/or reactivation of hiv-1 within reservoir microenvironments are not well understood. mscs within lymphoid tissues are well-known to interact with both macrophages and t-cells to regulate their activation phenotype24,27,28. our current findings, using the latently-infected monocytic cell line (u1) and the t-cell lines [ach2 and j-lat (9.2)], clearly indicated a novel role of tissue resident mscs in dictating latency-reactivation. furthermore, our molecular mechanistic studies implicate a crucial role of pi3k and nfκb signaling pathways, and the potential of several pharmaceutical drugs to suppress constant reservoir reactivation by mscs. last, but not the least, we provide evidence that factors secreted from mscs, or the novel signaling pathways activated during latency-reactivation, may be exploited to enhance the latency-reactivation efficacy of approved lras like panobinostat. therefore, mscs may have a crucial function in dictating hiv-1 reservoir persistence & propagation (fig. 8a) and a clear understanding of signaling pathways that regulate msc-mediated latency-reactivation may provide effective therapeutic strategies against these reservoirs (fig. 8b).figure 8putative molecular effects of msc-secretome on latency-reactivation from tissue hiv-1 reservoirs. (a) schematics of possible interactions between mscs & latently-infected cells within tissue hiv-1 reservoirs. the following steps may be involved in persistence, propagation and transmission of hiv-1 from reservoirs microenvironments: (1) factors secreted from latently-infected cells (macs & thls) may recruit tissue-resident mscs; (2) these reservoir-recruited mscs may closely interact with latently-infected cells, where reciprocal signaling (cell-to-cell and/or secretome-mediated) may facilitate virus reactivation; (3) the reservoir-recruited mscs may also be activated to secrete factors that constantly reactivate hiv-1 from latency, generating an inflammatory microenvironment that enable further recruitment of infectable cells; and (4) these productively infected reservoir cells may then migrate into the blood and enable rapid viral rebound. (b) signaling pathways involved in msc-secretome (asc-cm) mediated hiv-1 reactivation from latently-infected macs (u1 cells). the potent suppressive effects of ly294002 & px-866 implicate a direct role for the pi3k signaling pathway. the potent effect of bardoxolone-methyl (cddo-me) also suggests that nf-κb activation is a mechanism of this latency-reactivation. interestingly however, increased reactivation by the akt inhibitor (124005) and decreased reactivation by the akt activator (sc-79) also suggest the involvement of a non-canonical pi3k-nfκb dependent pathway, where the downstream akt pathway has a negative regulatory effect on msc-mediated latency-reactivation from tissue resident macs.full size imagewe observed that factors secreted by mscs enable hiv-1 reactivation from two latently-infected cell line models, i.e. u1 (monocytic cells) and ach2 (t-cells). factors secreted from mscs (both ascs and bmscs) but not from adipocytes, enabled rapid and potent hiv-1 activation from both u1 cells (figs 1,2) and ach2 cells (fig. 5). studies using both u-494 cells (figs 1,7) and j-lat (9.2) cells (fig. 5) indicated that soluble factors from mscs can increase hiv-1 ltr directed transcription of the latent provirus. furthermore, we documented that the latently-infected cells secrete factors that efficiently attract mscs (fig. 3) and mscs with enhanced migratory ability (mmscs) retain their latency-reactivation ability (fig. 3). importantly, coexposure to the msc-secreted factors enhanced the lra efficacy of panobinostat (fig. 6). studies using signal transduction inhibitors implicated a crucial role for both the pi3k and nfκb signaling pathway in asc-mediated latency-reactivation. the pi3k inhibitor, px-866 and the nfκb inhibitor, cddo-me (bm) two drugs currently in several clinical trials, were able to suppress the hiv-1 reactivation by the msc secreted factors. thus, latently-infected cells can recruit mscs which enable latency-reactivation via a pi3k & nfκb dependent mechanism.although we did not investigate the effects of asc-secreted factor(s) on primary cells, findings using the well-established u1 cell line model44,45 and the two t-cell line models of hiv-1 latency, i.e. ach2 and j-lat (9.2)13,14,15 clearly indicate a general phenomenon that stromal factors are directly involved in latency-reactivation. furthermore, the latency-reactivation potential of both ascs and bmscs suggest their crucial role in latency-reactivation within multiple tissue hiv-1 reservoirs.we documented that soluble factor(s) secreted from latently-infected cells enable msc activation, and pre-incubation of mscs to u1 secreted factors further increased the migration and homing abilities of mscs. indeed, several recent investigations have provided evidence that the secretome of latently-infected t-cells (ach2) can activate second messenger signaling and increase cell adhesion and migration46. several glycoproteins, e.g. galectin-3-binding protein, l-selectin and neogenin, were significantly elevated in ach2 secretome46. these studies, along with our current findings, underscore the significance of cell-to-cell interactions in regulating latency and/or reactivation of the hiv-1 reservoirs, which may be exploited towards strategies for targeted elimination of these persistent reservoirs. our findings indicate that mscs will migrate to and reactivate the latent provirus in u1 cells, and these activities may be further increased following exposure to factors secreted by these latently infected cells.although, in our current study, we have not identified the specific msc-secreted factor(s) that are responsible for latency-reactivation from both u1 & ach2 cells, future proteomic analysis may facilitate their identification. due to their therapeutic value, a number of recent studies have conducted proteomic analysis of factors secreted by mscs, both soluble factors47 and those secreted via exosomes48. these studies document several cytokines and chemokines which may be involved in activating the pi3k & nfκb pathways in lymphoid cells49,50,51. our studies using signal transduction inhibitors is of critical importance and may help in the discovery of novel lras that may be used alone or in conjunction with currently approved lras. indeed, our findings on the crucial roles of pi3k and nfκb signaling pathways and the negative regulatory effect of the akt pathway in msc-mediated latency reactivation, clearly indicate the potential to design superior reservoir targeted agents.the translational significance of our findings was documented by the coexposure of u1 cells to asc-conditioned media (asc-cm) and other lras. we observed that asc-cm significantly increases the latency-reactivation ability of pma, a pkc-agonist (figs 1c and 4e) and panobinostat, a hdaci (fig. 6). therefore, factors secreted by mscs, or specific signaling pathways activated by primary human mscs, may provide novel and superior strategies to activate the latent tissue reservoirs, and will no doubt be of more physiologic significance33,38,52. in this respect, several laboratories have shown that the combination of lras with different mechanisms of action may be more effective and less toxic in vivo37,38,53. coexposure to bryostatin (a pkc-agonist) and panobinostat (a hdaci) provided better latency reactivation, as compared to each of these agents alone53.although the role of pi3k signaling in provirus reactivation has not been well investigated, a recent study has shown that an activator of pi3k signaling, compound 57704 [1,2,9,10-tetramethoxy-7h-dibenzoquinolin-7-one] can reactivate hiv-1 in several cell-line models of latency, e.g. u1, j89gfp and ach-254. this quinolinone compound was also found to be a specific agonist of the pi3k p110α isoform, but not the p110β, δ or γ isoforms54. another recent study by kumar et al., (2017) documented that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), which is a downstream target of pi3k and akt, is necessary for hiv-1 production from u1 cells55. indeed, similar to our findings using sc-79 (an akt-activator), which suppressed asc-mediated latency-reactivation; these investigators demonstrated that inhibition of mtorc1 or pi3k was able to inhibit hiv-1 reactivation as well55. therefore, the crucial role of pi3k pathway, and more specifically, the cross-talk between the pi3k and nfκb pathways, should provide a novel therapeutic approach. our studies using both px866 and cddo-me showed that asc-mediated hiv-1 reactivation requires both pi3k and nfκb pathways, and studies using 124005 and sc-79 indicated that latency-reactivation may be negatively regulated by akt. interestingly, although the pi3k inhibitor, ly294002 was able to block latency-reactivation, only a slight decrease in total pi3k(p110β) and nef protein levels were observed, indicating that other pi3k isoforms may be responsible for latency-reactivation via mscs.additionally, our in vitro studies showed that the orally available pi3k-inhibitor, px-866, currently in clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent56 and the potent nf-kb inhibitor, cddo-me (bardoxolone-methyl; bm) currently in clinical trials for chronic kidney disease and diabetes57,58 may be of significant translational value to target the hiv-1 reservoirs. our findings on the migration and homing ability of mscs also implicate the potential of reservoir-tropic mscs as anti-hiv gene delivery vehicles. indeed, the tumor-homing ability of mscs are being actively tested for the delivery of anti-cancer genes to sequestered metastatic sites59,60 and thus, the inherent latency-reactivation potential of mscs and their inherent tropism for viral reservoirs may be exploited towards a novel cell-based gene therapy in hiv-1 infected patients.conclusion sour findings showed that factors secreted by mscs, obtained from ten different donors, enabled a rapid and potent hiv-1 reactivation from both latently-infected u1 (monocytic) & ach2 (t-cells). furthermore, exposure to factors secreted from these latently-infected cells were able to attract mscs, and these migratory mscs (mmscs) retained their latency-reactivation potential. coexposure to msc-secreted factors increased the efficacy of lras such as pma (a pkc agonist) and panobinostat (a hdac inhibitor). the orally available drugs px-866 (a pi3k inhibitor) and cddo-me (a nfκb inhibitor) suppressed msc-mediated latency-reactivation. therefore, investigations on the role of tissue-resident mscs in regulating hiv-1 latency and/or reactivation may provide a physiologically relevant model to understand the reservoir microenvironments in vivo. furthermore, our novel findings on the inductive effects of both pi3k and nfκb pathways and the suppressive effect of akt pathway in regulating msc-mediated latency-reactivation may facilitate the discovery of more effective strategies to eliminate the persistent hiv-1 reservoirs in patients.methodscell cultureu1 (cat#165), ach2 (cat#349) and j-lat(9.2) (cat#9848) cells were obtained from aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih. u937 cells were purchased from american type culture collection (atcc, va, usa). these cell lines were cultured in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 1%

under liquid nitrogen in 10% dmso containing media.antibodies and chemicalsthe following two antibodies were obtained from aids reagent program, division of aids, niaid, nih: (1) anti-hiv-1 nef polyclonal from dr. ronald swanstrom (catalog #2949) and (2) antiserum to hiv-1 tat from dr. bryan cullen (cat#705). antibodies against akt, phospho-akt and pi3k p110β were purchased from cell signaling (danvers, ma). antibodies against nfκb p65 & phospho-p65 and gapdh were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology (dallas, tx). the nf-κb inducer, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) was from abcam (cambridge, ma) and the nf-κb inhibitor, bardoxolone-methyl (cddo-me) was from selleckchem (houston, tx). the akt inhibitor, 124005, was from calbiochem (san diego, ca) and the akt-inducer, sc79 was from cayman chemicals (ann arobor, mi). the hdac inhibitors, vorinostat and panobinostat were also purchased from cayman chemicals. the pi3k inhibitors, ly294002 and px-866 were from selleckchem and cayman chemicals, respectively. drugs were reconstituted in dmso, stored in aliquots at −80 °c, and diluted in media immediately before use.adipogenic differentiationascs (1 × 105 cells) were culture in 6-well plates till 80–90% confluent. cells were grown under either control scm media or the adipogenic differentiation medium (adm). the adm consisted of scm media supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (ibmx), 50 μm indomethacin and 0.5 μm dexamethasone61. complete media was replenished every three days. after 12 days, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 0.5% oil red-o to verify adipogenic differentiation61. in parallel plates, conditioned media (cm) were collected from either ascs (asc-cm) or differentiated adipocytes (ad-cm) and stored at −20 °c for later use. the latency-reactivation ability of both asc-cm and ad-cm were compared.scratch wound assaychanges in migratory ability of ascs were measured using scratch wound assays62. briefly, ascs were allowed to generate a confluent monolayer in 12-well petri dishes. plates were then scored with a sterile p200 pipette tip to enable a wound of approximately 0.4–0.5 mm in width. culture medium was replaced with either serum free medium (sfm) or with the cm from cells, either u937-cm or u1-cm. ascs were allowed to migrate at 37 °c for 48 h. images were acquired using a phase-contrast microscope and wound-widths measured using the image-j software (version 1.50). results from quadruplicate wells were analyzed.transwell migration assaymigration of ascs towards u1-cm was assessed by using a transwell chambers (twc) containing polycarbonate membrane inserts (8 μm pore) from corning (cambridge, ma). briefly, ascs (3.0 × 104 cells/500 μl) were seeded in the upper chamber of twcs and allowed to migrate toward the lower chamber containing either serum free media (sfm) or cm from either u937 cells or u1 cells (u937-cm or u1-cm, respectively). after 24 h, non-migratory cells were carefully removed from the upper chamber and cells attached to bottom of the inserts were fixed (70% methanol) and stained (0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol). images of stained cells were captured using an inverted bright-field microscope (10x). migrated cells were enumerated and analyzed by imagej (version 1.50). in parallel plates, following the transwell migration assays, ascs were harvested from the top and bottom parts of twcs. these cells were then propagated and expanded, and cm was collected from both the non-migratory ascs (nmasc) and migratory ascs (masc) subpopulation. both the migratory ability and the latency-reactivation potential of ascs (both nmascs and mascs) were compared in subsequent studies.transwell coculture assaytranswell coculture assays were carried out using 24-well plates containing a 0.4 μm ptfe membrane insert (corning, ny) to avoid direct contact with ascs and u1 cells. equal number of ascs and u1 cells (10,000 cells each) were cultured in the upper and lower chambers, respectively. the ascs in the upper chamber was cultured in 300 μl of asc culture media and the u1 cells in the lower chamber was cultured in 700 μl of u1 culture media. at different time post trans-well coculture, we collected 300 μl of media from the lower chamber and centrifuged to obtain cell free conditioned media from the u1 cells. reactivation of hiv-1 from the latently-infected u1 cells was then assessed by measuring hiv-1 p24 levels by elisa.direct coculture assaycoculture of u1 cells with ascs were carried out at two different u1:asc cell ratios; either 1:5 or 1:1. cells were cocultured in 6-well plates in 3 ml growth media. a part of cell free culture supernatant (500 μl/well) after 3, 5 and 7 days of co-culture were collected and stored at −80 °c to measure hiv-1 p24 by elisa. in each time point, the u1 cell pellets were resuspended with equal amount of above mentioned fresh media and put them back to the corresponding wells and cultured with the indicated time points.hiv-1 p24 elisahiv-1 p24 levels in the culture supernatants were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kit from abl inc. (rockville, md) with minor modifications63. briefly, elisa plates were first washed with the wash buffer (4 times) and then treated with the disruption buffer. serial dilutions of cell-free supernatants from u1 cells were then added to these activated elisa plates. each plate also contained hiv-1 p24 protein standards (provided in the kit) and negative control wells. wells were covered with plate-sealer tape and incubated at 37 °c for 1 h. wells were then washed (5 times) and conjugate solution was added and incubated at 37 °c for 1 h. following another round of washing, the peroxidase substrate was added to each well and incubated at 37 °c for 30 min. after the addition of stop solution, the absorbance of each well (at 450 nm wavelength) was quantified by using a biotek synergyhtx plate reader (biotek instruments; winooski, vermont). the hiv-1 p24 levels (pg/ml) were calculated using the standard curves.hiv-1 ltr activity assaytranscriptional activity of the hiv-1 ltr was evaluated by using a reporter cell line, u937-vrx494 (u-494)64. briefly, u937 cells were transduced with a replication-defective lentiviral vector lv-vrx494, which regulates gfp expression under the control of hiv-1 ltr. in each experiment, u-494 cells were cultured under different treatment conditions, either stimulators or inhibitors. flow cytometric analysis of gfp levels was carried after 48 h by using a bd lsr-ii flow cytometer (bd biosciences; san jose, ca). images of cells were also captured by using an inverted bright-field microscope (20x). both the number of gfp positive cells and their mean fluorescence intensities (mfi) were quantified.western immunoblotimmunoblot analysis was performed according to our previous published protocols62. briefly, cells were lysed in ripa buffer from santa cruz biosciences (santa cruz, ca). protein contents were quantified by using a bca protein assay kit from thermo scientific (waltham, ma). equal amount of protein extracts was electrophoresed in 10% sds-page gels. separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, treated with a blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature, and then incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °c for overnight. next day, membranes were washed and incubated with horse radish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. membranes were then exposed to supersignaltm west femto substrate (thermo scientific) and scanned using imagequant las-500 (ge healthcare; princeton, nj).statistical analysisall data were summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, and standard deviation. the analysis of variance (anova) method was used to compare mean differences. where meaningful, results were presented graphically. the study hypotheses were tested at 5% level of significance throughout the analysis. significant changes from control values were determined by using a two-tailed student’s t-test and comparison between groups was carried out by anova.

Persistent metabolic changes in HIV-infected patients during the first year of combination antiretroviral therapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35271-0,Research,16 November 2018,yes,"the hiv-human metabolic relationship is a complex interaction convoluted even more by antiretroviral therapy (cart) and comorbidities. the ability of cart to undo the hiv induced metabolic dysregulation is unclear and under-investigated. using targeted metabolomics and multiplex immune biomarker analysis, we characterized plasma samples obtained from 18 untreated hiv-1-infected adult patients and compared these to a non-hiv infected (n = 23) control population. the biogenic amine perturbations during an untreated hiv infection implicated altered tryptophan- nitrogen- and muscle metabolism. furthermore, the lipid profiles of untreated patients were also significantly altered compared to controls. in untreated hiv infection, the sphingomyelins and phospholipids correlated negatively to markers of infection ip-10 and sil-2r whereas a strong association was found between triglycerides and mcp-1. in a second cohort, we characterized plasma samples obtained from 28 hiv-1-infected adult patients before and 12 months after the start of cart, to investigate the immune-metabolic changes associated with cart. the identified altered immune-metabolic pathways of an untreated hiv infection showed minimal change after 12 months of cart. in conclusion , 12 months of cart impacts only mildly on the metabolic dysregulation underlying an untreated hiv infection and provide insights into the comorbidities present in virally suppressed hiv patients.
introduction the interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) with its host is a complex process with a growing body of literature revealing the capacity of hiv to induce a plethora of metabolic changes in the human body1,2,3,4,5. hypertriglyceridemia was identified as one of the first metabolic consequences of hiv infection6. since then, studies using mass spectrometry (ms) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) applied to biofluids of hiv-infected individuals have confirmed the presence of hiv induced metabolic alterations1,7,8,9. investigating in vitro models of hiv infection using primary macrophages and cd4+ t-cells had different metabolic outcomes during hiv infection. cd4+ t-cells infected with hiv exhibited increased glucose uptake and upregulated glycolytic intermediates compared to reduced glucose uptake and steady-state glycolytic intermediates in hiv-infected macrophages10. while, in vivo models using rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) revealed increased fatty acids, phospholipids, and acyl-carnitines, suggesting an impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation11. comparatively, serum and plasma derived from hiv infected individuals revealed altered metabolites of lipid and mitochondrial pathways as well as organic acids and fatty acids1,5. moreover, the saliva from hiv-infected patients versus healthy controls revealed alterations in carbohydrate biosynthesis and degradation2.infection with hiv causes a progressive malfunctioning of the human immune system. hiv infection depletes cd4+ t-cells, while also inducing functionally exhausted cd8+ t-cells and impaired nk cells, leaving the host vulnerable to opportunistic infections12. furthermore, the metabolic and immunological changes in untreated hiv patients increase the risk of developing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (cvd), insulin resistance and hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand)13,14.the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) provided an important lifeline for hiv patients, since cart effectively inhibits hiv replication to undetectable levels, while also enabling the restoration of the immune system with increasing cd4+ t-cell counts. nevertheless, important metabolic-related side-effects of cart are reported in patient populations, mainly lipodystrophy and insulin resistance, which may further predispose virally suppressed patients to increased cvd, diabetes, and kidney damage15,16,17. also, studies have shown that although cart dramatically decreased the incidence of the most severe clinical phenotype of hand (hiv associated neurocognitive disorder) – hiv-associated dementia - in virally suppressed patients the milder forms of hand - asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment and mild neurocognitive disorders- have become more prevalent18,19. one aspect of the pathogenesis of cvd or hand in successfully treated hiv patients is that while cart effectively suppresses hiv replication and activity, low levels of immune activation are sustained20,21,22. the ability of cart to rectify the hiv-induced metabolic dysregulation is unclear and under-investigated. however, this may be highly relevant since persistent metabolic stress could be an underlying pathogenic mechanism in the comorbidities of untreated hiv patients as well as cart suppressed hiv patients. robust characterization of the metabolic alterations experienced during hiv infection is needed to determine the effect of cart on these pathways, in cart suppressed hiv patients.to study this, we used comprehensive targeted metabolomics techniques integrated with classical immunological assays and compared changes in plasma of untreated hiv-1 patients to non-hiv infected individuals, and paired plasma of untreated hiv-1 patients at baseline to their plasma after 12 months of cart in the hiv-suppressed state, to assess whether profiles normalized to the situation in healthy individuals or remained perturbed. we found dysregulated biogenic amine and lipid metabolism in untreated hiv-infected patients, conditions that have been independently associated with the pathophysiology of cvd and hand. after 12 months of cart, metabolic changes were found for some biogenic amines, while the lipid metabolites revealed increasing levels in the virally suppressed patients.resultsuntreated hiv versus non-hiv-infected controlspatient population amost of the individuals in both the patient and the control populations listed in table 1 were male and caucasians. mean age did not differ between both groups. the mean cd4+ t-cell count of the hiv-1 patients was 441 × 106 cells/l with an interquartile range (iqr) of 367.5 × 106. the untreated hiv patients had a large heterogeneity in viral load with a median of 1.11 × 105 viral copies and an iqr of 2.64 × 105 especially when taking the minimum and maximum values as listed in table 1 into account.table 1 characteristics of the untreated hiv-infected patients (population a) and the non-hiv infected control population.full size tablealtered plasma metabolic profiles in untreated hiv-infected patientsto characterized metabolic alterations experienced during an untreated hiv-1 infection, we compared 18 untreated hiv-1-infected patients (population a) with 23 controls through profiling their biogenic amines, lipids, and signalling lipid metabolites. as shown in the volcano plot in fig. 1a, 18 biogenic amines were differently affected in hiv patients versus controls, with reduced levels in all (see supplementary table s1). reduced levels of antioxidants, including total glutathione and taurine, together with lipid headgroup moieties o-phosphoethanolamine and the choline metabolite sarcosine were identified as the most significantly altered amine metabolites during an untreated hiv infection. furthermore, untreated hiv patients had decreased levels of tryptophan and serotonin compared to controls. the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan (k/t) ratio, as a readout for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) activity, showed upregulated ido activity during untreated hiv infection compared to controls (p = 0.0003) (see supplementary fig. s1a). concurrently investigating the plasma serotonin/tryptophan ratio reflected the consequences of increased ido activity for serotonin synthesis during untreated hiv infection compared to controls (p < 0.0001) (see supplementary fig. s1b). decreased levels of the branch chain amino acids leucine and isoleucine as well as carnosine reflected impaired muscle metabolism during an untreated hiv infection. the significantly decreased levels of ornithine and putrescine in untreated hiv patients also hints at a reduced urea cycle and thus ammonia clearance in these patients compared to controls. additionally, decreased levels of alanine, asparagine, α-aminobutyric acid, tyrosine, and methionine were also detected in untreated hiv patients compared to controls. evaluation of the levels of plasma lipids, which included the different lysophospholipids classes, phospholipids, di/triglycerides, sphingomyelins, ceramides, and cholesterol esters, revealed 44 modulated metabolites with a p < 0.05 and a fold-change (fc) ≥ 1.30 or ≤0.70 (fig. 1b and supplementary table s2). the lysophospholipids class presented with 6 lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) species having increased plasma levels in untreated hiv-infected patients versus controls, and one lysophosphatidylcholine (lpc) metabolite which was reduced compared to controls. furthermore, two monounsaturated sphingomyelin (sm) species, two pufa cholesterol ester (ce), and two long-chain saturated ceramides (cer) metabolites all had reduced levels in untreated hiv patients. the triglycerides (tg) profile presented with 14 mostly polyunsaturated triglycerides species showing significantly increased levels during untreated hiv infection. the phospholipids presented with seven phosphatidylcholines (pc), four plasmalogen phosphatidylcholines (pc-o), two phosphatidylethanolamines (pe) and two plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamines (pe-o) all having decreased levels during untreated hiv.figure 1plasma metabolic characterization of untreated hiv vs controls. volcano plot of (a) the biogenic amine profile.

(fig. 1c, supplementary table s3). the four signalling mediators: 5,6-dihetre, 8,9-dihetre, 11,12-dihetre, and 14,15-dihetre all derived from arachidonic acid and synthesised by cytochrome p450 isozymes showed the most significant increased levels in the untreated hiv patients compared to the controls. furthermore, untreated hiv patients had increased levels of dihydrosphingosine but decreased levels of three different sphingosine-1-phosphate species compared to controls. the metabolites 5-hete, 12-hete and 15-hete derived from the lipoxygenase activity on arachidonic acid, also had increased levels compared to the controls. oxidized lipids due to the activity of ros and rns showed differential responses with increased levels of 8-iso-pge2, 2,3-dinor-pgf2a and 20 hete and decreased levels of 11-hdohe and 8,12-ipf2α-iv in untreated hiv patients compared to controls.untreated hiv versus hiv-suppressed (12 months of cart)patient population bthe characteristics of the hiv-1-infected patients selected to compare baseline metabolic profile to the hiv-suppressed profile after 12 months of therapy (population b) are presented in table 2. this is an independent population from the untreated hiv-infected population a introduced in table 1. most of the patients had a male gender. mean cd4+ t-cell count at the start of cart was of 267 × 106 cells/l with an iqr of 224 × 106. there was a large heterogenicity in viral load with a median of 5.5 × 104 copies/ml and an iqr of 2.7 × 105. 89% of the patients were of european descent. four patients had a blip in their viral load at 12 months on cart: their viral loads were 53, 73, 103 and 130 copies/ml. most patients used abacavir in combination with lamivudine as the backbone in cart (n = 25). the patients who only used nrti’s all used the combination abacavir with lamivudine and zidovudine (n = 8) except for one patient who used abacavir/lamivudine with stavudine. the protease inhibitors (pi) used were lopinavir (in combination with ritonavir) (n = 4), atazanavir (n = 1) and darunavir (n = 1). the nnrti’s used were efavirenz (n = 8), nevirapine (n = 4) and rilpivirine (n = 1). five patients used a statin. the incidence of dyslipidaemia or the use of lipid-lowering therapy (statins and/or fibrates) remained stable during the first year of cart.table 2 characteristics of 28 hiv-infected patients (population b) at baseline and after 12 months of cart.full size tablemetabolic consequences following cart treatment of hiv patientsnext, we evaluated the metabolic changes associated with 12 months of cart treatment, as well as hiv suppression in the longitudinal patient population b. cart treatment of the hiv patients resulted in viral suppression with undetectable plasma hiv rna levels and partial restoration of cd4+ t-cell counts in the blood (table 2). eight hiv infected patients were hcv positive, but were untreated for hcv during the 12-month period and were not excluded from the analyses. the untreated hcv infection had minimal impact on the metabolic findings as can be seen in see supplementary fig. s2. evaluation of biogenic amine levels in paired plasma samples showed significantly increased methionine sulfone, histidine and tryptophan levels during the therapy period as compared to the baseline samples (untreated hiv), whereas pipecolic acid, 3-aminoisobutyric acid, and kynurenine showed significantly decreased levels during the therapy period as compared to the baseline (fig. 2a, supplementary table s4). significant metabolites were identified by having a false discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05 using a paired t-test approach. the k/t ratio revealed significantly decreased ido activation after 12 months of cart (see supplementary fig. s3), however, the ratio between tryptophan and serotonin showed no significant changes. the neurotransmitter dopamine and metabolite α-aminobutyric acid correlated with cd4+ t-cell counts during 12 months of therapy (see supplementary fig. s4a).figure 2plasma metabolic characterization of response to 12 months’ cart. modified volcano plots showing (a) the biogenic amine profile, and (b) the lipid profile. the modified volcano plots are representative of the −log10(fdr adjusted paired t-test p-value) on the y-axis with the x-axis showing the scaled mean of the paired differences per metabolite, between the baseline and 12 months cart follow-up sample (patient population b). the horizontal dashed line represents a false discovery rate adjusted q-value < 0.05. significant metabolites are identifiable by coloured symbols with either a name or corresponding class colour identifier. ce – cholesterol esters; lpc – lysophosphatidylcholines; pc – phosphatidylcholines; pc-o - plasmalogen pcs; pe – phosphatidylethanolamines; pe-o – plasmalogens pes; sm – sphingomyelins.full size imagethe lipid profile showed an overall increasing trend reflecting higher levels after the 12-month cart period compared to their baseline levels, as can be seen in fig. 2b. predominantly it was the phosphatidylcholine metabolism responding to cart with significantly increased levels of 9 phosphatidylcholine species, 8 plasmalogen phosphatidylcholine, and 3 lysophosphatidylcholine species after 12 months of cart compared to baseline values prior to starting of cart. furthermore, 7 sphingomyelin metabolites, together with one phosphatidylethanolamine species, two plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamine, and a cholesterol ester were also increased after 12 months of cart compared to their baseline values. furthermore, the phosphatidylcholines also revealed a positive association with cd4+ t-cell counts of the patients (see supplementary fig. s4b).finally, we compared changes in the signalling lipid profiles in patient plasma after 12 months of cart to their untreated hiv levels and found no significant changes.plasma immune-metabolic networks of hiv infection and therapyplasma levels of cytokines and immune mediators are a commonly used readout reflecting systemic immune activity23,24. to correlate metabolite profiles in plasma with immune activity, we determined in subsequent plasma samples of the same patients the levels of the infection markers ip-10, sil-2r, and d-dimer, the inflammation markers il-6, il-10, il-21, il-18, and mcp-1, and the soluble exhaustion markers spd1, spd-l1, spd-l2, and stim3. significantly enhanced plasma levels of d-dimer, il-18, mcp-1, spd-l2, stim-3, ip-10, sil-2r, crp, and stnf-rii were observed in patients with untreated hiv as compared to non-hiv infected controls (population a), and are shown in supplementary fig. s5. the other mediators tested were below the limit of detection of the assay, which included il-6, il-10, il-21, spd1, and spd-l1.evaluating the changes in the immunological parameters in population b after the 12 months cart period revealed an immunological picture of effective therapy shown in supplementary fig. s6. markers of infection revealed that after the initiation of cart, both plasma ip-10 and sil-2r levels were reduced significantly. furthermore, initiation of cart reduced the levels of the inflammation marker il-18 whereas mcp-1 levels remained unchanged when comparing baseline to 12 months of cart. an improvement in markers of exhaustion was found with reducing levels of both spd-l2 and stim3 after 12 months of cart.next, we constructed immune-metabolic correlation networks respectively for the controls and the patients with an untreated hiv infection from population b using the absolute of levels of metabolites and immune mediators. figure 3 presents these three immune-metabolic correlation networks showing all correlations with a strict p-value cut-off of p < 0.01. comparing fig. 3a (the control network) to fig. 3b (the untreated hiv network) difference is seen in the interactions between the two networks. the control network revealed isolated clusters with ip-10 and il-18 correlating to different lipid classes, sil-2r and stnf-rii correlated together and d-dimer, stim3 and mcp-1 showing correlation. comparatively the untreated hiv shows positive correlations between stim-3, sil-2r, ip-10 and spd-l2 with d-dimer connecting the network through stim-3, revealing correlations between markers of infection and exhaustion. in both networks, stim-3 and d-dimer revealed strong positive correlations, while in the untreated hiv patients stim-2 also showed strong interactions with phospholipids as well as lysophospholipids. furthermore, in untreated hiv patients mcp-1 correlated strongly to several triglyceride species compared to the control network where mcp-1 correlate only to d-dimer. interestingly, in the control network, il-18 showed strong interactions with triglyceride species, whereas il-18 was correlated to only 5,6-dihetre in the untreated hiv patients.figure 3immune-metabolic networks of controls, untreated hiv and the influence of cart. (a) control immune-metabolic correlation network based on correlating the absolute levels of plasma metabolites and plasma cytokines in the control group. (b) untreated hiv immune-metabolic correlation network based on correlating the absolute levels of plasma metabolites and plasma cytokines in the untreated hiv group (population b). (c) the immune-metabolic correlation network following 12 months cart. using the paired samples of population b, the relative change in levels of 12 months’ cart compared to their baseline levels (untreated hiv sample) were determined for plasma metabolites and cytokines and subsequently correlated. for all three networks, spearman correlations were performed and significant correlations were defined as having a strict p-value (two-tailed) < 0.01.full size imagenext, for the influence of cart on hiv infection, we constructed immune-metabolic correlation network based on the relative change in levels of metabolites and immune mediators in the paired plasma of the patients on 12 months cart versus their untreated hiv levels. as shown in fig. 3c, the correlation network revealed distinct immune-metabolic interactions. firstly, changes in stim-3, sil-2r, ip-10, spd-l2 and il-18 positively correlated with each other, with d-dimer becoming disconnected from the core network. again, mcp-1 showed minimal interactions to other immune mediators in the panel: changes in triglyceride levels correlated strongly to changes in mcp-1 levels as did some amine metabolites, while changes in two cholesterol-esters showed negative correlations. furthermore, cart diminished the interaction of stim-3 with the phospholipids and lysophospholipids which were found in untreated hiv-patients.discussion the data presented in this study provide some insight into the distinct effects of hiv and cart have on metabolism. through identifying immune-metabolic pathways altered during untreated hiv infection, we can follow these pathways during the first 12 months after commencing cart in the same patients, monitoring their responses. in line with earlier research, we found decreased glutathione, taurine and tryptophan levels as well as upregulated ido activity in untreated hiv patients compared to hiv-seronegative controls8,25,26. also, increased levels of highly unsaturated long-chain triglycerides27 and decreased levels of sphingomyelin species characterized an untreated hiv infection compared to controls. after the initiation of cart, changes in the lipid metabolism were primarily found within the phospholipids while the highly unsaturated triglyceride species remained elevated. a noteworthy metabolic finding is the unresponsive signalling lipid profile, showing minimal changes after the first 12-month cart period. signalling lipids including eicosanoids are metabolically derived immunological mediators and might represent a metabolic reflection of the immune competence of hiv-infected patients28,29. the unresponsive signalling lipid metabolism could result from the sequestering of their polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors into triglyceride species. cassol et al. reported decreased eicosanoid levels specifically 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-hete), prostaglandin b2, prostaglandin e2 and thromboxane b2 in cart-treated hiv-positive individuals compared to controls1. since eicosanoids also play an essential role in immunological crosstalk30 it could help to explain the dysregulated immune surveillance and exhausted phenotype persisting in virally suppressed patients31.studying the immune-metabolic networks revealed that the initiation of cart disconnected the interactions between kynurenine and sil-2r as well as stim-3’s interactions with phospholipids and lysophospholipids. thus, hiv suppression through cart attenuates the pro-inflammatory sil-2r and ido pathways differently, since it has been reported that ido activity remains significantly increased compared to controls even after 24 months of cart32. secondly, cart might contribute to an exhausted immune phenotype through dysregulating the phospholipids (increased during the first 12 months of cart) and their interactions with stim-3 interactions. further, il-18, a pro-inflammatory cytokine found elevated in advanced stages of hiv infection33, showed strong correlations to triglyceride levels in the control population. the role of il-18 in cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its association with triglyceride levels, has been previously described34,35. comparatively, in the untreated hiv infected population, the triglyceride species showed a strong correlation to mcp-1 levels and not to il-18. initiating 12 months of cart was unable to nullify this interaction, revealing that changes in triglyceride levels still strongly correlated to those of mcp-1 in the paired patient samples. mihăilescu et al., found that the prevalence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome was higher in hiv suppressed patients compared to virally active patients, and that the levels of mcp-1 correlated to both these co-morbidities36, supporting our findings.disentangling the mechanism behind the observed metabolic changes during an hiv infection and therapy is a complex task. however, the importance of this task is stressed by the findings in this study that even 12 months of cart does not attenuate metabolic dysregulation. this is opposed to the finding that immune activation in hiv-infected patients is normalized during treatment with cart for this same period, as we also previously showed33. sustained immune activation thus is not the complete answer to what causes co-morbidity in hiv-infected patients, like neurocognitive disorders and cardiovascular disease. although cart has become increasingly effective over the last years, but as we show here, is not enough to fully restore the metabolic profile of hiv-suppressed patients to normal.this finding warrants further research, to contribute to unravelling the metabolic pathophysiological pathways in hiv comorbidities, with multiple findings in this study able to generate testable hypothesis regarding hand and cvd. with respect to hand, the following questions arise applicable to both untreated hiv and cart-treated hiv patients. (1) how does the sustained elevated indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (ido) activity (the rate-limiting enzyme catabolizing l-tryptophan into neurotoxic metabolites and not serotonin) contribute to neurological disorders? (2) what is the pathological mechanism underlying a dysregulated urea cycle during an untreated hiv infection? since disorders of the urea cycle are known to manifest with neurological implications due to hyperammonemia37. similarly to hand, questions relating to cvd, an important cause of morbidity and mortality in untreated and suppressed hiv-infected patients, arises38,39. (3) do the significant correlations between changes in triglycerides and mcp-1 levels, expose an alternative mechanism contributing to the development of cvd, independent of il-18? (4) how does an unresponsive eicosanoid metabolism contribute to cvd, since they play an important role in normal cardiovascular function?40,41,42. potentially with the answer to these questions, morbidity, and mortality in hiv-infected patients because of the non-communicable disease can be further diminished.it is important to note that in our study the time of follow-up of these patients was too short to draw conclusion s about causality. the use of targeted metabolomics platforms in conjunction with other omics technologies would provide a unique opportunity to study hiv pathogenic mechanisms, as well as to identify biomarkers relevant to co-morbidities relating to both hiv and the use of arvs. studies investigating the metabolic dysregulation of hiv infections and exposure of antiretrovirals can be further strengthened by investigating paired longitudinal samples with a known outcome. furthermore, these techniques could also proof complementary to antiretrovirals pharmacokinetic studies currently in clinical trials.it is important to mention that due to the retrospective nature of the part of our study in which we compared cart naïve hiv-infected patients with their samples after 12 months of therapy, it is difficult to ascertain whether all blood samples were processed identically, thereby introducing some variation in outcome parameters. further, the duration of the hiv infection prior to starting cart is not known of these patients. apart from the hiv infection, other factors might play a role in metabolic changes, for instance, smoking habits, aging, and timing of sampling of the material. also, we have no data on the fasting state of both the patient as well as the control population, however, because the samples of the included patients were taken during routine outpatient visits and blood donors, in general, are instructed not to donate blood in the fasted state, it is safe to assume that both groups were in a post-prandial state. food intake can affect metabolites and phospholipid levels43,44, but also multiple large population studies have shown that changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins change only modestly during the day, in response to habitual food intake45,46. further, although sub-analysis of 12 months cart according to pi or nnrti used did not show differences in lipid profiles, the choice of the specific components of the cart regimen might be a significant factor or influence on the metabolic profile of a patient in the long run. for instance, abacavir use, which is associated in the literature with an increase of cvd47,48. population a and b differed significantly from each other regarding mean cd4+ t-cell counts and cytokine profiles, probably due to the fact that population a was selected to be compared to a non-hiv infected, healthy control population and therefor selection criteria was more strictly defined than those for population b, where the patients were their own controls. in population b, five patients were using statins during the first year of cart, of which four were already receiving statin therapy prior to the start of cart. we were unable to identify any trends in the data indicating that lipid profiles were skewed based on the use of statins. eight patients were coinfected with hcv, which may have had an effect on the comparison of the untreated patients compared to controls. however, during this study, none of the patients was treated for hcv, thus this was a stable factor in the comparison between untreated hiv and 12 months of cart. a sub-analysis leaving out the hcv coinfected patients showed minimal impact on the outcome. in this study, we were not able to include a sample of the control patients after one year. however, to determine the baseline stability of the metabolic/immune network, further studies are needed with follow-up samples of a control population.in conclusion , in our study, we found significant changes in the metabolism relevant of untreated hiv infected patients and after 12 months cart. additional to this finding, and potentially even more important is the finding that cart alone does not restore these changes. further insight into the metabolic changes caused by hiv infection is warranted to optimize therapy in addition to cart for this patient population.methodspatients and sample collectionuntreated hiv versus non-hiv-infected controls, population afor the comparison of metabolic profiles of untreated hiv-1-infected patients to a non-hiv infected control population, 18 hiv-1-infected, cart naïve patients were selected from the outpatient clinic of the erasmus medical center in rotterdam, the netherlands, archived sample bank. the plasma was stored at −80 °c. inclusion criteria were age over 18 years and no previous treatment for hiv. exclusion criteria were severe comorbidity (e.g. diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, opportunistic infection), coinfection with hepatitis b or c, use of alcohol > 2 iu/day and use of co-medication. all patients had given written informed consent for inclusion in the database of the dutch hiv monitoring foundation (stichting hiv monitoring; shm) also known as the aids therapy evaluation in the netherlands (athena) cohort, and collection of demographic, laboratory and clinical data from the medical records and storage and future use for scientific research of biological material. their plasma samples were compared to a non-hiv infected control population from volunteers (n = 23), without comorbidity or co-medication, which had all given their written informed consent.untreated hiv versus hiv-suppressed (12 months of cart), population bfor the comparison of metabolic profiles of untreated hiv-1-infected patients to the hiv-suppressed situation, plasma samples of 28 hiv-1-infected patients from the outpatient clinic of the maastricht university medical center in maastricht, the netherlands were selected in the archived sample bank. the plasma was stored at −80 °c. all patients had given written informed consent for inclusion in the database of the dutch hiv monitoring foundation and collection of demographic, laboratory and clinical data from the medical records and storage and future use for scientific research of biological material. from each included patient, a plasma sample was selected from before the start of cart and at 12 months after the start of cart. all patients were older than 18 years at the start of cart and had not received any previous art therapy. all patients started with a cart regimen containing abacavir. the patients had no diabetes mellitus and no diagnosed autoimmune diseases. we retrieved information regarding dyslipidaemia from the earlier laboratory results prior to the 12 months samples after the start of cart. because the patients were generally not in care prior to the hiv diagnosis, no values were available from the blood sample prior to the start of cart. the study was performed according to the helsinki declaration and approved by the ethical committee of the maastricht university medical center.targeted lc-ms

a set of qc samples was then included during the analyses of the experimental groups on the individual metabolomic platforms and evenly distributed across the randomized samples prior to lc-ms analyses. in addition, independent duplicate samples (10–15%) were randomly selected. using the qc samples and duplicate samples, a double-qc approach was applied to include metabolites that were reliably measured by the individual metabolomics platforms by reporting and using only those metabolites for which both duplicate samples and qc samples showed an rsd < 30%.multiplex immunoassays to assess plasma biomarkersthe levels of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and other proteins were determined using the procarta plex human immune monitoring panel (affymetrix, vienna, austria). the

to the manufacturer’s instructions, identical to the procedures used in our previous studies53,54,55. the concentrations of analytes were measured using the microsphere-based multiplex luminex-100 (luminex corporation, austin, tx, usa), samples to compare untreated hiv with non-hiv controls were analyzed in a different run than paired samples of untreated and hiv-suppressed patients. data were analyzed using procartaplexanalyst 1.0 (www.ebioscience.com/resources/procartaplex-analyst-1.0-software.htm).statistical analysesspss 21.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa) was used for fisher’s exact

r script‒based online tool metaboanalyst 3.0, a comprehensive tool suitable for analysing metabolomics data56. the metabolomics datasets were log transformed and auto-scaled prior to bioinformatics analyses. for the analyses between controls and untreated hiv patients, significant metabolites were identified per metabolomics platform based on the following criteria: i. a p-value < 0.05 using the unpaired student t-test, and ii. a fold change (fc) ≥ 1.30 or ≤0.70, indicating a 30% increase or decrease. the false discovery rate’s q-values are reported for every reported p-value. for the analyses between the paired untreated hiv patients and 12 months cart follow up, significant metabolites were identified per metabolomics platform based on a false discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05 using a paired student t-test. plasma protein biomarkers were analysed using the unpaired student t-test for comparing controls and untreated hiv patients, and the paired student t-tests across the paired patients’ samples at baseline and 12 months. graphpad prism 7 software was used in the rendering of graphs and figures.two types of immune-metabolic correlation networks were done. firstly, for the control group and the untreated hiv patient group, independent spearman correlation analyses were done using the absolute metabolite and cytokine levels. next, per group cytokine levels were correlated with each other to form the network skeleton. the second type of correlation network was based on spearman correlations of the levels of metabolites to cytokines in hiv-suppressed patients after 12 months of cart relative to the levels at baseline from paired patient samples (relative change = 12 months cart – baseline). next, we correlated the relative change in cytokine levels to form the network skeleton. for both types of immune-metabolic correlations significant correlations were defined using a cut-off p-value (two-tailed) < 0.01 and were visualized as a

Rationally designed carbohydrate-occluded epitopes elicit HIV-1 Env-specific antibodies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08876-w,Research,27 February 2019,yes,"an array of carbohydrates masks the hiv-1 surface protein env, contributing to the evasion of humoral immunity. in most hiv-1 isolates ‘glycan holes’ occur due to natural sequence variation, potentially revealing the underlying protein surface to the immune system. here we computationally design epitopes that mimic such surface features (carbohydrate-occluded neutralization epitopes or cone) of env through ‘epitope transplantation’, in which the target region is presented on a carrier protein scaffold with preserved structural properties. scaffolds displaying the four cones are examined for structure and immunogenicity. crystal structures of two designed proteins reflect the computational models and accurately mimic the native conformations of cones. the sera from rabbits immunized with several cone immunogens display env binding activity. our method determines essential structural elements for targets of protective antibodies. the ability to design immunogens with high mimicry to viral proteins also makes possible the exploration of new templates for vaccine development.
introduction hiv-1 carries on a continuous battle with the host immune system1,2. as the sole target of neutralizing antibodies, the virion surface protein env encodes a glycan shield to restrict the antibody access to antigenically conserved sites3,4. there are about 30 sites of carbohydrate addition on each hiv-1 env protomer, and about two-thirds of the n-linked carbohydrates cover the generally conserved outer domain of env5,6. this glycan shield serves as a barrier to an antibody response that would otherwise be directed at surface features of env7,8,9. variation in carbohydrate addition sites has been documented wherein 90% of hiv-1 strains are missing at least one conserved glycosylation site10,11. when env trimers from different hiv-1 clades (a, b, and c) were used as immunogens, the autologous neutralizing antibody response was targeted to the protein face at the site of missing glycans12,13. similarly, the siv variants missing a dispensable glycan were used to infect macaques and gave rise to an antibody response that targets the exposed area3,14. infection with a virus missing a glycan on the env α2 helix led to the development of an antibody escape mutant that reacquired the original glycosylation site, suggesting that antibodies to such surface features of env can provide selective pressure and thus be protective15. it is these types of carbohydrate-occluded structural features we refer to as cones. we reason that hiv-1 isolates present a collective vulnerability at the surface features under variable glycosylated sites. we set out to exploit their immunogenic nature by eliciting antibodies that interact specifically with individual cones.we previously examined the env gene of hiv-1 subtype c, which accounts for ~50% of new infections worldwide, including samples from acutely and chronically infected individuals10. our results demonstrated moderate conservation of twenty-two n-linked glycosylation sites on the env outer face, including positions 130, 230, 234, 289, 332, 337, 356, and 442 (hxb2 numbering), with each glycosylation site appearing in 65–85% of hiv-1 isolates. we find that seventeen of these moderately conserved glycosylation sites cluster around six surface structural features, and we hypothesize the absence of a surface glycan at any one of these cones would expose the underlying protein structural elements (fig. 1a and supplementary fig. 1). analysis of transmitted hiv-1 isolates revealed that 93% were missing at least one carbohydrate in one of the cones, with 80% missing carbohydrates in two or more cones10. in previous studies, others have built structural mimetic of cone 3 (a four-stranded β sheet at the base of the v1/v2 loops) and cone 6 (the cd4 binding site) for structure-guided immunization. chimeric glycoproteins encoding cone 3 bind the broadly neutralizing antibody pg916. protein nanoparticles containing cone 6 mimetics engage the germline precursors of vrc01-class neutralizing antibodies and direct the evolution of antibodies against the cd4 binding site17,18. here we focus our protein design efforts on four cones, including the structural elements of β sheet 12/13/22 (cone 1), α2 helix (cone 2), loop c (cone 4), and loop e (cone 5) (fig. 1b). small protein mimics of the cones are designed by epitope transplantation and used as immunogens to focus the antibody response19,20,21. our experimental workflow includes biophysical and structural characterization of the designed proteins, followed by immunogenic evaluation in animal models (fig. 1c).fig. 1rational design of hiv-1 immunogens and elicitation of antibodies targeting the cones. a fully glycosylated env (upper panel) encodes a shield of glycan (dark blue) masking its conserved surface. in underglycosylated env (lower panel) the carbohydrate-occluded neutralization epitopes (cones) are exposed. the transmitted hiv-1 viruses isolated from infected individuals are typically missing at least one carbohydrate in one cone (shown in colors, see key in panel b). b small protein mimics of the cones, designed by epitope transplantation, can serve as potential immunogens to focus the antibody response towards cones. c the experimental workflow includes biophysical characterization (circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography), structural characterization (x-ray crystallography, nmr) of designed proteins, and immunogenic evaluation in animal models. d consensus protein sequences of the cones. the site convergence data were derived from 183 env sequences of clade c hiv-1 isolated from acutely infected patients. the solvent-exposed resides in env are marked with red boxesfull size imageresultsstructure-based immunogen designatomic-level details of the fully glycosylated, pre-fusion conformation of the env trimer have been obtained as crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures5,22. the conformations of the cones are well conserved in the structures of env from clades a, b, c, and g (supplementary fig. 1b). we identified the substructural elements of each cone based on the bg505 sosip.664 trimer structure (protein data bank [pdb]: 4tvp and 4nco) and adopted the consensus sequence of clade c hiv-1 env as the reference for the immunogen design23,24 (fig. 1d and supplementary fig. 2). the rationales for identifying cones include: (i) the change of solvent-exposed area on the env surface due to absence of glycans. the boundaries of cone residues can be determined by modeling the interactions between underglycosylated env and immunoglobulin (supplementary fig. 3). (ii) whether the sub-structures of cones can be readily matched to existing scaffolds in pdb (see methods). (iii) conservation of surface glycan10,11. using a rapid structural motif-mining algorithm erebus25 (supplementary fig. 4, workflow), we searched the pdb for scaffolds capable of supporting the disembodied cone structures (three-stranded β-sheet, α-helix, and two separate loops). we estimated the surface matching between scaffolds and cones by analysis of root-mean-square deviations (rmsd, 0.5–3.0 å) and selected the top-ranking scaffolds for each cone (supplementary table 1). the surface amino acids of the cone-like region within each scaffold were replaced by solvent-exposed residues in the consensus sequences of cones (supplementary figs 2 and 4). for instance, a discontinuous three β-strand motif was grafted onto cone 1 scaffolds, while the two helixes on the cone 2 and scaffold 5 design (c2s5, a similar nomenclature is followed for all designed proteins) displayed the α2 helix-specific residues (supplementary fig. 5). the modified scaffold was subsequently relaxed by discrete molecular dynamics26.for each scaffold, multiple designs (86 in total) were generated adopting various combinations of cone residues and their substitutes in the consensus sequences. we then estimated the change in free energy of these substitutions (δδgmut) using the eris molecular design suite and discarded highly destabilizing mutations (55 designs of δδgmut > 6 kcal mol−1)27. the conformational stabilities of all cone mimetics were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed us to rapidly screen the designed protein library and choose the scaffolds that exhibited substantial rigidity around the cone segment (root-mean-square fluctuations (rmsf) analysis, supplementary fig. 6). a recent study of massively parallel protein design demonstrated that structural elements of the most successful designs exhibit high similarity to natural proteins of similar local sequences28. hence, we reasoned that the success of epitope transplantation would correlate with the compatibility between local structure of grafted sequences and their native conformation in env, whereas higher rmsf of grafted residues indicates that the design explores wider conformational states and likely displays poor agreement to the target structure. therefore, we filtered out the designs featuring significant plasticity of the grafted epitopes or designated them as alternative scaffolds (21 designs of rmsf > 3.5 å at cones). overall, three to five designs of each cone were expressed in escherichia coli (supplementary fig. 5). of the sixteen candidates tested (one most stable design for each scaffold), eight could be successfully purified as soluble proteins (supplementary table 2).biophysical characterization of designed proteinsthe eight proteins exhibited circular dichroism (cd) spectra consistent with the designed topology (supplementary fig. 7a). the stabilities of the designs to thermal denaturation were assessed by cd spectroscopy. their melting temperatures (tm) were in the range of 42–75 °c (supplementary fig. 7b). the cone 1, 2, and 4 proteins were monomeric in solution (supplementary fig. 7c, d), while the c5s3 design displayed rapid exchange between monomeric and dimeric states. we selected the most stable designs (c1s1, c2s5, and c4s3) for immunization experiments and further structural analysis.to determine whether the designs recapitulate the native conformations of each cone, we solved the crystal structures of c2s5 (α2 helix) and c4s3 (loop c) at resolutions of 2.0 å and 1.2 å, respectively (pdb 6cfe and 6cbu, table 1). the electron density maps revealed that the side chains of the grafted residues were well positioned relative to the computational model (supplementary fig. 8). comparison with the env trimer protein revealed a high degree of mimicry: within the epitope region, the cα rmsds between the designed proteins and env were 0.42 å (c2s5) and 0.34 å (c4s3), respectively, suggesting that our cone mimetics accurately display the env residues (fig. 2a, b). the c2s5 scaffold is built on a four-helix bundle from apolipoprotein e3. the two helixes used to display the cone 2 residues were well matched to the α2 helix in terms of the cα-cβ orientations (fig. 2a and supplementary fig. 8d). the cone 4 (loop c) residues were grafted onto the c-terminal loop region of an α/β mixed protein (fig. 2b). a characteristic array of three glutamic acids flanked by hydrophobic residues defines the conformation of cone 4 loop in env. our design largely recapitulates the conformations of two charged side chains (e88 and e89). the hydrophobic residue l86 also adopts a similar conformation to l265 of env (fig. 2b). consistent with the molecular dynamics simulation, we found that the c4s3 loop adopted a relatively rigid structure, as assessed by the low b-factors (8–12 å2, supplementary fig. 6).table 1 crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsfull size tablefig.

(right) 1h-15n hsqc spectrum with the assignments to cone 1 residues indicated. source data are provided as a source data file. see also supplementary fig. 9full size imagewe also acquired structural information for c1s1 using nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). the two-dimensional 1h-15n heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (hsqc) spectrum suggests that c1s1 is well folded in solution (fig. 2c, right panel). we were able to assign 72 of 77 peaks corresponding to c1s1 residues with the aid of the hncacb and cbca(co)nh spectra (supplementary fig. 9). the backbone information derived from cα/cβ chemical shift indicates that c1s1 possesses four β-strands (three from cone 1 and one from the scaffold protein: hnrnp rna-binding domain) and two α-helices, as expected based on the design model (fig. 2c, left panel). all cone 1-associated residues adopted a β-strand conformation (middle panel).immunogenic evaluation of cone immunogenswe next immunized small groups of rabbits (four to six per group) with the designed immunogens to raise cone-specific antibodies. two different immunization strategies were applied: incomplete freund’s adjuvant (fa) and a nanoparticle (np) formulation without adjuvant (supplementary tables 3, 4, supplementary fig. 10). in these initial immunization experiments, we sought a qualitative understanding of the nature of the antibodies that can be generated to each cone. the cone 1, 2, 4, and 5 mimetics were all immunogenic, giving rise to autologous binding antibodies as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa, fig. 3a). the fa-associated immunization protocols induced antibodies with the titers more than 10-fold higher than those induced by np-associated immunization. as a control experiment, we also immunized five rabbits with a synthetic peptide of the cone 4 sequence (laeeei). none of these rabbits could induce antisera of significant titers (supplementary table 5), in contrast to the c4s3-immunized rabbits, indicating that for a linear epitope, constraining it in the right conformation with suitable protein scaffolds is favorable for the generation of functional antibodies.fig. 3characterization of antibodies in the sera from rabbits immunized with cones. a anti-cone endpoint titers were determined by elisa during the immunization process. the data represent the mean titers for each group of rabbits. the boost injections were performed monthly, with bleedings performed three weeks after each boost. n = number of rabbits (4–6, indicated for each immunogen). error bars represent standard deviation. b western blots demonstrating the binding of purified rabbit igg to pngase-deglycosylated gp120 (~60 kda band, lanes 2, 4, and 6 in plots of cone 4 and 5). no interaction between the igg and glycosylated gp120 (~120 kda band, lanes 1, 3, and 5 in plots of cone 4 and 5) was observed.

evaluated antibody specificity for the cone-derived epitopes (supplementary fig. 11). for each immunogen, an alternative design (c1s5, c2s3, c4s2, and c5s2, supplementary table 2) with the same cone grafted onto a different scaffold protein was used as a control to hiv-specific responses. no hiv-specific antibodies were obtained after immunization with cone 2 (α2 helix). the cone 4 (loop c) and cone 5 (loop e) immunogens did induce hiv-specific antibodies as assessed by elisa and western blot assay. the purified igg fractions of anti-cone 4 and anti-cone 5 rabbit sera bound to the deglycosylated form of gp120 but not the glycosylated protein (fig. 3b).we also analyzed the anti-env responses of individual rabbit sera in an elisa assay using the deglycosylated env sosip trimer. we modified the sequence of sosip from the original bg505 sosip.664 isolate23, so that the exposed residues at the cone regions represent the consensus sequences of env subtype c. the sera of the rabbits immunized with c1s1 (fa protocol) contained antibodies that bound env, featuring a significantly elevated response to env in comparison to the homologous pre-immune sera; in contrast, only one animal generated strong-binding antibodies with c1s1-nps (supplementary fig. 12). most of the animals immunized with c4s3 also generated antibodies that bound to the deglycosylated sosip env protein, whereas no such antibodies were detected in animals immunized with c5s3.four c1s1-immunized rabbits generated sera with the highest reactivity to the sosip trimer. we tested these serum samples in a virus neutralization assay against reporter hiv-1 viruses, which were pseudotyped using three different env gene clones (682, 1086, and 3037, all subtype c). the viruses expressing the wt env represent the samples isolated from infected subjects, while the fully glycosylated env and the mutants represent the cone-concealed and cone-revealed samples, respectively (fig. 4). in this analysis, we accounted for the animal-to-animal variation by comparing responses of the pre-immune serum and the immunization endpoint serum for each rabbit and each virus. the four post-immunization rabbit sera exhibited modest virus inhibitory activity in comparison to the homologous pre-immune serum. the highest responses we observed (50–70% inhibition) were with virus 3037 (missing n332 and n448 glycans) by the serum of rabbit 481, and with virus 1086 (missing n332 glycan) by the serum of rabbit s1206. given the low level of virus inhibition associated with these sera it is difficult to distinguish if this activity represents true virus neutralization or some type of nonspecific inhibition of infectivity, although we note this activity is differentially present after immunization. the observed inhibitory activity did not depend critically on the absence of the cone 1-associated glycans on the env protein surface. if this does represent antibody-mediated neutralization, then the rabbit-raised cone 1-specific antibodies may possess long loops in the complementarity-determining region that are capable of penetrating the glycan shield, as seen in various neutralizing antibodies characterized previously1,7,8. in this scenario the occluded surface features may not be immunogenic under the glycan shield, but the corresponding antibodies when they exist may be able to intercalate between structurally dynamic glycan side chains, thus resulting in neutralization.fig. 4anti-cone 1 rabbit sera have moderate inhibitory activity against pseudotyped hiv-1. pre- and post-immunization sera were heat inactivated, diluted 1:10 in media, and incubated with pseudotyped hiv-1 for 2 h before addition to tzm-bl cell culture. the inducible luciferase activity was quantified as a surrogate of viral infectivity. percent neutralization (%) was determined by subtracting the pre- and post-immunization relative light units (rlu) from the virus-only rlu (not shown) and dividing the differences by the virus-only rlu. each experiment was repeated three times. pseudotyped hiv-1 isolates included in the assays: v682, v1086, and v3037. rabbits id: s1201, s1206, s1207 and 481. n = 3 independent experiments. error bars represent standard deviation. source data are provided as a source data filefull size imagediscussion the strategies that hiv-1 adopts to avoid in vivo neutralization, including hypervariable protein sequences and a glycan coat that occludes the conserved protein surface, confounded the attempts at immunization using env trimer as antigens29,30. here we described the implementation of an approach based on the observation that less conserved glycosylation sites are occasionally absent due to the intrinsic sequence variation in hiv-1. our results point to the possibility of generating antibodies that target surface features of env at ‘glycan holes’. we found that binding of anti-cones 4 and 5 antibodies to denatured gp120 critically depended on the removal of the proximal glycan. also, the reactivities of anti-cones 1 and 4 antibodies with the sosip env were greatly enhanced after deglycosylation. the magnitude of inhibitory effect upon hiv-1 infectivity was modest with the anti-cone 1 sera tested, although the consistency of the effect against multiple isolates of hiv-1 env pseudoviruses is indicative of a robust activity.rational protein design has reinvigorated vaccine design efforts19,31,32. scaffolded immunogens can focus immune responses to known neutralizing antibody determinants31 or, as in our work with the hiv-1 cones, can facilitate the exploitation of new vulnerable sites. the cones reside on an immunogenic ‘silent face’ of gp120; however, a recent study reported the identification of neutralizing antibody vrc-pg05 that recognizes several cone 1 residues (e293, n448) as well as cone 1 glycans (n295, n448) (supplementary fig. 13)33. this observation suggests the presence of germline antibody precursors that engage cone-related epitopes. to achieve a functional broadly neutralizing response, a viable approach could be administrating a cocktail of cone mimetics and sosip env protein missing corresponding cone glycans in successive and combinatorial boosts, focusing the response on the ‘glycan hole’. we expect that rational design of small, thermal-stable cone-like immunogens represents a promising starting point for the development of reproducible vaccines against persisting infections.methodsdetermination of the consensus sequence of subtype c gp120the consensus amino acid sequence of gp120 subtype c was obtained by aligning 183 full-length env sequences derived by single genome amplification10. the dataset includes: 68 acute env sequences, 65 chronic env sequences, 21 functional env clone sequences from gavi study, and 29 env sequences from viruses present in a group of participants with low cd4 counts. the amino acid position was considered a consensus if it was present in 80% of the isolates. the consensus sequences illustration for fig. 1d was prepared using weblogo34,35.we also modified the original sequence of a soluble gp140 protein (sosip bg505.664) so that the exposed amino acid residues of the protein that originally belonged to hiv-1 subtype a virus were replaced with residues from hiv-1 subtype c virus. the modifications were performed for the regions that correspond to cone 1, 2, 4, and 5. sequence manipulations were performed using bioedit software and hiv sequence database tools available at los alamos national laboratory website (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/hiv/mainpage.html).computational protein designthe identification of scaffold proteins for transplantation of cone epitopes made use of the erebus substructure search server (https://dokhlab.med.psu.edu/erebus)25. query structures for this server were defined as the backbone atoms (cα, ν, c=o) of each individual cone (β 12/13/22, α2-helix, loop c, and loop e). we aligned the structures of env trimer (pdb id: 4tvp and 4nco for clade a env, 5fyk for clade b, 5fyj for clade g) and extracted the coordinates of backbone atoms. the query structures (pdb format) were then provided to erebus with default search parameters (matching precision 0.5 and minimum weight ‘auto’). erebus scans pdb for matches of structural scaffolds to atom pairs in the query. these resulting scaffolds were ranked based on their rmsd to the query structure (supplementary table 1).redesign of preexisting scaffolds was accomplished using eris, a computational platform that automatically performs side-chain repacking and backbone relaxation and calculates the changes in free energy upon mutations (δδg = δgmut − δgwt, https://dokhlab.med.psu.edu/eris)27,36. the solvent-exposed area of each residue in env was computed with naccess 2.1.1 (asa value > 0.3 means exposed). the exposed residues within each cone were introduced into the corresponding scaffolds by eris. for each single mutation, eris typically performed 100–300 calculations to reach a converged distribution of δδg values. the average δδg and its standard deviation were obtained. highly destabilizing mutations (δδg > 6 kcal mol−1) were discarded. the structures of design models were then relaxed and equilibrated by all-atom dmd simulations.to estimate the structural rigidity of cone epitopes within designed proteins, md simulations were performed under physiological conditions (100 ns simulation at 298 k, 150 mm nacl, and neutral ph) with gromacs37. the force field charmm36 was adopted with the explicit solvent model tip3p38. the simulations were performed at constant temperature (v-rescale thermostat) and pressure (1 bar, parrinello-rahman npt ensemble). the non-bonded interaction cut-off for electrostatics calculations was set to 10.0 å, and the particle mesh ewald (pme) method was used in the calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions. three independent simulations were performed for each design, and the trajectories were analyzed to derive information about the average structure and rmsf.protein expression and purificationthe genes encoding the designed proteins were synthesized by biomatik and cloned into bamhi and ncoi restriction sites of pet14b vectors (invitrogen). all constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing. e. coli bl21(de3) plyse strains transformed with each individual gene were grown to an optimal density (optical density 0.6 at 600 nm) in lysogeny broth, and then gene expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyransoide. proteins expressed with an n-terminal his tag (mghhhhhhgsenlyfqg) were purified on a histrap column (ge healthcare) and then by size exclusion chromatography (hiprep 16/60 sephacryl s-200 hr). briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm nah2po4/na2hpo4, 40 mm imidazol, 100 mm nacl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, ph 7.4) with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and pepstatin a) and lysed by sonication. the supernatant containing protein components was separated from precipitate by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 30 min, passed through 0.22-μm filter (millipore), and then loaded onto a histrap column. proteins were eluted with a gradient (5–90%, 500 mm imidazol as 100%) of imidazol in 20 mm nah2po4/na2hpo4, 100 mm nacl, ph 7.4. for the sephacryl 200 column 50 mm nah2po4/na2hpo4 and 150 mm nacl (ph 7.4) was used as running buffer. the his tag was removed by tev protease (sigma-aldrich) following the manufacturer’s procedure. the cleaved proteins were enriched in flow through of the histrap column and were further purified through a hiload 16/600 superdex 200 preparatory-grade column (ge healthcare). the his tags were not removed from proteins conjugated to nanoparticles for immunization.for nmr measurements, e. coli bl21(de3) plyse strains containing the c1s1 gene (in pet14b) were grown in m9 minimal medium with 1.0 g l−1 15nh4cl and 2.0 g l−1 13c dextrose (cambridge isotope laboratories, inc.). proteins were expressed and purified following the same procedure as used for those obtained from cells grown in lysogeny broth medium.chemicals and enzymes were purchased from sigma-aldrich unless otherwise indicated. protein concentrations were determined on a nanodrop spectrophotometer using absorption at 280 nm (thermo scientific).biophysical characterizationcd spectroscopy data was collected using a chirascan plus instrument (applied photophysics, ma). the protein samples were dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and diluted to 0.2 mg ml−1 before analysis. cd spectra were measured from 260 to 185 nm at 20 °c with 50,000 readings taken with 0.5-nm increment. melting curves were monitored from 20 to 94 °c at 220 nm and fitted to a two-state folding model for the estimation of melting temperatures39.the protein samples for size exclusion analysis (10 μm protein in 40 mm na2hpo4/nah2po4, 100 mm nacl, ph 7.4) were loaded onto a superdex 200 10/300 gl column (ge healthcare, pa) and eluted with the same pbs buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. uv absorption at 280 nm was monitored. three molecular weight markers were also analyzed: cytochrome c (12.4 kda), aprotinin (6512 da), and vitamin b12 (1355 da). the log of molecular weight versus elution volume for those proteins was plotted for the column and used to calculate the apparent molecular weight of designed proteins.crystallization, data collection, phasing, and refinementprotein samples for crystallization (10–50 mg ml−1 in 20 mm tris, 150 mm nacl, ph 8.0) were prepared by column chromatography and ultrafiltration. sparse matrix screens in 96-well sitting drops were performed on rigaku phoenix liquid handler with mcsg crystallization suite. crystallization conditions were then optimized for c2s5 and c4s3 in 24-well hanging drops. c2s5 was crystallized in 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20000, 100 mm mes, ph 6.5. c4s3 was crystallized in 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm bis-tris ph 6.5, and 200 mm liso4. crystals were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol, then flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. the crystals were checked for high quality x-ray diffraction using rigaku saturn 944 + cdd with actor sample changing robot. diffraction data was then collected on advanced photon source (argonne national laboratory) at beamlines 22-id and 22-bm (wavelength 0.9782 å) and processed on hkl200040. the structures of c2s5 and c4s3 were solved by molecular replacement with phaser of ccp4i and phenix41,42. briefly, the crystal structures of the scaffold proteins (pdb id 1bz4 for c2s5 and 2w4c for c4s3) were used as search models. the structures were built and manually adjusted in coot and then refined by refmac5 (or by phenix with composite omit map and tls refinement options). the structures were validated using pdb validation server, molprobity and chiron server (https://dokhlab.med.psu.edu/chiron)26,43. data collection and final refinement statistics are shown in table 1.nmrfor nmr measurements, 13c and 15n-enriched c1s1 protein (1 mm) was exchanged into nmr buffer (20 mm na2hpo4/nah2po4 ph 6.0). five percent (v/v) d2o and 10 μm dss (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) were added to the protein solution. nmr spectra were acquired at 25 °c on a bruker avance iii 850 nmr spectrometer. 2d 1h-15n hsqc experiments were recorded using 16 scans per increment and a recovery delay of 1.0 s with 2048 and 256 complex points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. spectral widths used were 7911.393 hz (1h) and 2152.949 (15n) hz. average 1h-15n chemical shift perturbations were calculated according to the square root of ((δσ 1h)2 + (δσ 15n)2/25), where δσ 1h and δσ 15n are the observed changes in 1h and 15n chemical shifts.1h-15n hsqc spectra allow for the detection of protons directly bonded to a 15n, including both backbone and side-chain nh resonances. an nh resonance can be detected for every residue except for proline and the spectrum contains a ‘fingerprint’ of the protein backbone. backbone resonance assignments of c1s1 were obtained by analysis of hncacb and cbca(co)nh spectra recorded on 13c and 15n-labeled c1s1 at the same concentration employed for 2d hsqc experiments. the spectra were recorded with 2048 (1h), 64 (15n), and 128 (13c) complex points. spectral widths were 10204.082 hz (1h), 2929.115 hz (15n), and 12820.513 hz (13c).the assignments of cα, cβ, n, and hn chemical shifts were performed with an iterative procedure using the program mars and manual inspection44. for chemical shift indexing (csi), δcα and δcβ values were calculated by subtracting experiment chemical shifts of cα and cβ from random coil values obtained from the ncidp server45. the value of δcα−δcβ was calculated to cancel the systematic offset contained in δcα and δcβ and then used to predict secondary structure. g17, g25, g43, g57, g61, g63, and g86 have no cβ and their δcα−δcβ values were not calculated. spectra were processed and analyzed using nmrpipe (niddk, national institutes of health) and sparky (university of california, san francisco).general immunization procedureimmunogen injections and animal handling were performed by the division of laboratory animal medicine staff of unc-chapel hill. all work with animals followed protocols that were approved by the unc chapel hill institutional animal care and use committee. intra-muscular injections were performed on 8–12-week-old new zealand white female rabbits (2.5–3.0 kg) obtained from robinson services. the immunization protocols are summarized in supplementary table 3. the immunization scheme was an initial dose of 300 μg of each cone followed by boost injections, supplemented with either incomplete freund’s adjuvant according to the standard protocol, or nickel-conjugated nanoparticles without additional adjuvant. immunogen boost injections with the same amount of protein were performed 3 weeks apart. the immunization of loop c peptide was performed by the custom antibodies department of thermo fisher scientific company.for cone 2 immunization, two changes were introduced. first, the single scaffold-immunogen (c2s5) was compared to two scaffold-immunogens (c2s5 + c2s3) approach. in the latter approach, we alternated injections of the proteins with the same structure and hiv-specific sequence presented on different scaffolds. second, we assessed the possibility to use the saponin-based adjuvant matrix-m™ (novavax ab) as a substitute for the nanoparticles. matrix-m adjuvant was kindly provided by novavax, inc. for the first 8 weeks, 30 µg of protein were given at each injection. lower antibody titers were observed than previously obtained with 300 μg of conjugated protein; therefore, the cone 2 immunization plan was amended. after 8 weeks the amount of immunogen was increased from initial 30 μg protein to 300 μg conjugated on nanoparticles, without an adjuvant. this change of protein amount is noted in fig. 3a.immunization with nanoparticlesnickel nanoparticles (nps) were prepared from warm oil/water (o/w) microemulsion precursors following a reported procedure46,47. in the optimized formulation, brij 78 (1.75 mg), brij 78-nta-ni (1.75 mg), tpgs (1.5 mg), and miglyol 812 (2.5 mg) were weighed into a 7 ml glass vial and heated in a water bath to 65 °c to melt and blend all excipients. a small amount of ethanol (100 μl) was added to the melted excipients and the solution was swirled to result in a homogenous mixture. the ethanol was removed completely using a stream of nitrogen and the vial was transferred to a water bath at 65 °c. to the mixture of melted oil and surfactants was added 1 ml of filtered and deionized water pre-heated at 65 °c, and the solution was stirred for 30 min at 65 °c then cooled to room temperature.nps (1 ml batches, n = 3 for each protein concentration) were characterized for particle size (nanosight), zeta potential, and ni content ni content (icp-ms) prior to addition of protein. the ni-nps (0.5 ml) were incubated with the corresponding amount of his-tagged protein (c1s1, c2s5, c4s3, or c5s3) at 4 °c overnight. final protein concentrations added to 0.5 ml of ni-nps were: 150 μg ml−1, 240 μg ml−1, 300 μg ml−1, 400 μg ml−1, and 500 μg ml−1. free his-tagged protein was removed by spin filtration using vivaspin 500 ultrafiltration tubes (300 kda mwco). sample containing protein and nps was transferred to a spin filtration tube and spun at 16,000 rcf for 30 min to remove free unconjugated protein. purified samples were analyzed by uv absorbance at 280 nm before and after spin filtration to quantify the percent conjugation of his-tagged protein to nps at each concentration (n = 3). the uv absorbance was measured using a biotek synergy 2 uv spectrometer (winooski) at a wavelength of 280 nm.polyoxyethylene (20) stearyl ether (brij 78) was purchased from uniqema (wilmington, de). d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (tpgs) was purchased from eastman chemicals (kingsport, tn). miglyol 812 is a mixed caprylic (c8:0) and capric (c10:0) fatty acid triglyceride and

purchased from fisher scientific.particle size and zeta potentialnps samples were run on a nanosight ns500. all samples were diluted to a concentration between 1 × 108 and 5 × 108 particles per ml in deionized h2o. five 60-s videos were taken of each sample to capture particles movement. the nanosight software tracked the particles individually and using the stokes–einstein equation, calculated the hydrodynamic diameters. the zeta potential of nps was measure in pbs (ph 7.4) using a malvern zeta sizer 2000 (malvern instruments).icp-ms analysisnickel content was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms). the agilent 7500cx icpms is outfitted with an octapole reaction cell (orc) and a high matrix introduction  (hmi) system. standard operating conditions were rf power 1550 w, argon flows and plasma gas flow 15 l min−1, carrier gas flow 1.03 l min−1, makeup gas 0.15 l min−1 and sampling depth was 8.0 mm. all solutions were prepared using 18 mω deionized water and trace metal grade nitric acid (scp science). the instrument was tuned daily to maximize sensitivity and minimize production of oxides and doubly charged ions. sample flow rate was 330 µl min−1 through a mienhard trp-50-a0.5 nebulizer and the scott double pass spray chamber was cooled to 2 °c. helium flowed at 4 ml min−1 through the orc to eliminate isobaric interferences, 44ca16o+ and 23na37cl+, of 60ni. standards were prepared using single element standards purchased from high purity standards. scandium was used as internal standard and introduced continuously through a tee junction. ions 45sc (internal standard) and 60ni were monitored in a peak hopping mode, using a 100-ms dwell time, and eight replicates were measured. the ni standard curve included 13 concentrations levels in the range of 0.5–1000 ppb. this spanned the concentration range of all samples. the standard dataset was fitted to a linear curve. the coefficient of correlation was 0.999. percent error in calculated concentrations was <5%. for quantitation of ni in the nps, preparation included removal of the water from the nps and resuspension in 2% hno3 solution.tem imagingpreparations of nps, matrix-m adjuvant, and protein alone and in combination were negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, ph 7.0. five microliters of suspension was applied to a glow-discharged formvar/carbon-coated 400 mesh copper grid and allowed to adsorb for 1 min or 5 min depending on concentration. grids were briefly floated on droplets of deionized water twice to remove buffer salts and were then transferred to a 25-µl droplet of 2% sodium phosphotungstate, ph 7.0 for 30 s. excess stain was removed by blotting with filter paper and the grids were air dried. grids were observed with a jeol jem-1230 transmission electron microscope (jeol usa) operating at 80 kv, and digital images were acquired using a gatan orius sc1000 ccd camera and gatan microscopy suite 3.0 software (gatan, inc.).elisathe autologous and heterologous binding properties of antibodies to the cone immunogens and sosip env were tested using the protein detector peroxidase elisa kit, anti-rabbit igg (kpl/sera care life sciences). the elisa assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol; minor modifications included plate coating overnight at 4 °c and color development for 1 h before addition of a stop solution. absorbance levels were measured at 405 nm. cone immunogens coated on microwell plates were exposed to serial dilutions (1:200 to 1:256,000) of the rabbit sera and the lowest titer was determined at the absorbance level >0.4, which was the two times recommended maximum background value for this kit. the primary immunogen and an alternative scaffold were used to confirm the specificity of the immune response. for the sosip elisa assay, the modified gp140 sosip-c protein was used. the protein was produced in 293f cell line at the unc protein expression & purification core facility and deglycosylated in native conditions by incubation for 24 h with pngase f according to the manufacturer’s protocol (new england biolabs).western blottotal rabbit igg was purified from each animal using rprotein a gravitrap kit (ge) according to the kit protocol, dialyzed against pbs buffer, and diluted to equal amount per cone immunization group. the gp120 proteins were deglycosylated using pngase f in sds buffer (new england biolabs). ten percent polyacrylamide gels and standard western blot protocol with superbock blocking reagent (thermofisher) was applied. the modified gp140 sosip-c proteins were produced at unc protein expression & purification core. the amount of any protein loaded per lane was 400 ng. purified igg pools from immunized animals (1 mg ml−1) were used as primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1500. hrp goat anti-rabbit antibody (thermo fisher cat #32460) was used as secondary antibody at a dilution 1:12500. the fluorescence signal was detected by amersham ecl western blotting detection kit (ge) using a biorad chemidoc imager. pageruler plus prestained ladder was used for band size discrimination. to confirm the successful transfer of the gp120 proteins, the blots were stripped using restore western blot stripping buffer (thermofisher) and restained with anti-gp140 rabbit igg solution (1 mg ml−1 and 1:12,500 dilution) that targeted a variety of epitopes on gp120 and served as our positive control for both glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins. scans of all blots were supplied in the source data file.neutralization assaysto assess neutralizing properties of raised antibodies, we used a panel of hiv-1 pseudoviruses that expressed isolate-specific env proteins, incubated the virus with rabbit serum, and assessed viral infectivity in the luciferase-expressing tzm-bl cells using a standard protocol (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/nab-reference-strains/html/protocol-for-neutralizing-antibody-assay-for-hiv-1-in-tzmbl-cells_apr2017.pdf). tzm-bl cells were obtained from nih aids reagent program (cat. # 8129). based on similarities to cone immunogens, we chose the following hiv-1 isolates with corresponding genbank ids: 0665 (gb# kc894076), 0682 (gb# kc894077), 1086 (gb# kc894079), 3003 (gb# kc894087), and 3037 (gb# kc894098). in those cases where the natural isolate lacked one or more of the relatively conserved glycosylation sites, these were added back to create the fully glycosylated form for that isolate. the fully glycosylated form was then mutated to remove the glycosylation site at env positions specific for cone proteins. for cone 1, a glycan at the position 332 (n332s) or at the position 448 (n448s) was removed. for cone 2, a single glycan in alpha-helix at the position 337 (n337/339s) was removed. for cones 4 and 5, the glycans n289s and n356/358s were removed, respectively. all positions are listed in reference to hxb2 hiv-1 viral strain. the envelope sequences of the isolates were pseudotyped on the hiv-1 subtype c viral backbone, and single-cycle infection virus was produced in hek293t cells. pre- and post-immunization sera were heat inactivated and diluted 1:10 in cell growth media. the inhibitory properties of post-immunization serum were compared to those of the pre-immunization serum for each animal. data were analyzed and plotted using graphpad prism 6.0 software.reporting summaryfurther information on experimental design is

Differentially expressed host long intergenic noncoding RNA and mRNA in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20791-6,Research,7 February 2018,yes,"non-coding rnas and mrnas have been implicated in replication, pathogenesis and host response in hiv infection. however, the impact of long intergenic non-coding rnas (lincrnas) on hiv-1 and hiv-2 infection is not known. in this study, we have analyzed expression profiles of lincrnas and mrnas in monocyte derived macrophages (mdms) infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 using microarrays. our study identified many differentially expressed lincrnas and mrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 compared to uninfected mdms. genes involved in glutathione metabolism and lysine degradation were differentially regulated only in hiv-1 infected mdms. in hiv-2 infected mdms, cul 2, sfrs9, and rbbp4 genes were differentially expressed. furthermore, we found that plasma levels of lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404 and lincrna: chr12: 57761837-57762303 were better indicators of hiv-1 infection while lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960, xloc_001148 and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451, were better indicators of hiv-2 infection. in summary, our study has demonstrated that there is substantial alteration in lincrna and mrna expression in response to hiv-1/hiv-2 infection. these differentially expressed lincrnas and mrnas could serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of hiv infection and help in the identification of new targets for therapy.
introduction the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is an rna virus belonging to the genera of lentiviruses, family of retrovirus that is characterized by its chronic and persistent infection. hiv can be further classified into two major types, hiv-1 and hiv-2. hiv-1 and hiv-2 are characterized by a high degree of genetic variation. hiv-1 can be further divided into major group m and minor groups o, n and p. hiv-1 group m, that is prevalent throughout the world, can be further subdivided based on genetic diversity into eleven different subtypes (a-k). hiv infection ultimately leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), which persists as one of the greatest global health challenges of this century1,2,3. without an effective vaccine in the near future, it is especially imminent and vital to explore and improve the methods of searching for new and novel host biomarkers of infection that could serve as new targets for therapy and aid in prognosis and diagnosis.hiv-1 and hiv-2 are closely related viruses that share common pathways involved in viral transmission, replication and pathogenesis. although hiv-1 and hiv-2 share many similar characteristics, major differences exist between them. hiv-1 is more virulent with higher levels of circulating virus than hiv-2. reports have indicated that hiv-2 infected patients who progress to aids live for a longer time and have relatively higher cd4 counts compared to hiv-1 infected patients who progress to aids.a recent study found that many hiv-2 infected patients remain as long term non-progressors and the mean time for progression to aids in hiv-2 infected patients was 14.3 years compared to 6.2 years in people infected with hiv-1. the progression time to death was 15.2 years in hiv-2 infected patients and 8.2 years in hiv-1 infected patients4. the mechanisms leading to these pathogenic differences are not fully comprehended. studies to elucidate the pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms involved in hiv-1/hiv-2 infections would help us in future to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.in the whole human genome, only <3% of genomic dna is transcribed into mrnas that code for proteins, while >80% of genomic dna is transcribed into rnas5 that do not encode proteins and are referred to as non-coding rna (ncrnas). these non-coding rna transcripts were previously considered as ‘junk’ in the genome. the ncrnas are categorized based on their size into small and long non-coding rnas (lncrnas > 200 nucleotides in length)6. the lncrnas constitute the bulk of ncrnas with current databases describing up to ~62 000 long non-coding rna genes compared to the ~20 000 known protein coding genes7,8. lncrnas can be further categorized as genic (exonic, intronic and overlapping) or intergenic lncrnas (lincrnas) according to their location with respect to the nearest protein-coding transcripts9. reports in the literature have indicated that lncrnas are not cloning artifacts or transcriptional noise but rather important supplements to proteins or crucial regulators functioning in complex networks10,11. studies have demonstrated that non coding rnas are capable of regulating gene expression during cellular differentiation12,13, and governing a wide-repertoire of molecular, biological and genetic processes including transcription14, translation15, splicing16, imprinting17, differentiation18, chromatin modification19, chromatin structure20, cell cycle control21, cellular structure22 and stem cell regulation23. in addition, lncrnas are implicated in performing a wide variety of functions in various pathophysiologic processes and in human diseases24,25,26,27.coding rnas28 and noncoding rnas, such as micrornas29 and lncrnas30, are involved in the development and progression of hiv-1 infection. we have previously reported that significant variations in amino acid biosynthetic pathways and cytopathic effects occur in hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected pbmcs in vitro28,31. we also found that the expression of phgdh and psat 1 genes expression were up regulated only in hiv-1 infected pbmcs and srsf9 gene expression is up regulated only in hiv-2 infected pbmcs28. in the current study, we have extended our previous observations to understand the variations of cellular responses and pathogenesis between hiv-1 and hiv-2 infections in mdms. macrophages play a key role in the host immune system by phagocytosing and eliminating obligatory pathogens like hiv-1, as well as initiating protective acquired immune responses through antigen presentation to t cells32. macrophages are considered to be the primary long term residence for hiv-1 in the host. furthermore, hiv-1 is able to evade major antiviral mechanisms of macrophages by exercising a variety of transcriptional process controls or by hijacking cellular machinery and reshaping host gene expression in their favor6,33. studies have shown that among the altered gene expression profiles induced by hiv-1 infection, both lincrnas and mrnas are important components. however, the regulation of lincrnas expression induced by hiv-1 and hiv-2, and the role played by these transcripts in modulating macrophage responses to hiv infection remains unclear. furthermore, studies elucidating the role of lincrnas in hiv-1 infection are at a preliminary stage and not much is known about the impact of lincrnas in hiv pathogenesis, emerging evidence indicates that lincrnas play an important role in the modulation of host factors and could serve as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for many diseases34,35.in this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 using microarrays. our results showed modulation of the expression of lincrnas and mrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 compared to uninfected mdms. go analysis and kegg pathway analysis performed on the differentially regulated mrnas suggested that different pathways and functions are involved in the macrophage response to hiv-1 and hiv-2 infection. genes involved in glutathione metabolism, lysine degradation and olfactory transduction, were differentially regulated in hiv-1 infected mdms. comparatively more genes were differentially regulated in mdms infected with hiv-2. notably, genes for proteins like cul 2, sfrs9 and rbbp4 were differentially regulated in mdms infected with hiv-2. from our study, two lincrnas, lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404 and lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303, were identified as potential host biomarkers of hiv-1 infection. similarly, lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960, xloc_001148 and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451, were identified as potential host biomarkers for hiv-2 infection. we also found that lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451, lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 and xloc_001148 could discriminate between hiv-1/hiv-2 infection and may serve as novel host biomarkers that could differentiate between hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patients. in summary, our study has demonstrated that there is substantial alteration in lincrna and mrna expression induced by hiv-1/hiv-2 infection, suggesting that these host factors may serve as potential biomarkers of infection and aid in the identification of new targets for therapy, prognosis and diagnosis.resultsdifferential regulation of lincrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2to determine the differential regulation profile of lincrnas in response to hiv-1 and hiv-2 day 7 post infection, microarray analyses were performed on three independent donor mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2. differentially expressed lincrnas, with more than two-fold change in expression and with a p value of ≤0.05 were picked for additional study. hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed lincrnas from six samples (fig. 1a and b) indicated that the differentially expressed lincrnas were classified into two groups, uninfected control vs hiv-1 infected and uninfected control vs hiv-2 infected. the scatter plot (1 c &1d) is the visualization method used for evaluating the lincrnas expression variation (or reproducibility) between arrays. the values of x axes and the y axes depicted in the scatter plots represents signal values that are normalized signal values of the groups compared. green lines represent fold change values of the differentially expressed lincrnas (the default fold change value is 2.0). figure 1e and f show the volcano plots for the differentially expressed lincrnas in uninfected control vs hiv-1 infection and uninfected control vs hiv-2 infection respectively.figure 1differential regulation of lincrnas in hiv-1 infected mdms, hiv-2 infected mdms and uninfected mdms.

(e,f) volcano plots of lincrna, expression fold change for hiv-1 (e) and hiv-2 (f) infections in mdms in comparison to uninfected control: the plot shows differentially regulated lincrnas with statistical significance that passed volcano plot filtering (fold change ≥ 2.0 and p-value ≤ 0.05). the vertical green lines correspond to 2.0-fold up and down and the horizontal green line represents a p-value up to 0.05. the red point in the plot represents differentially regulated genes with statistical significance. (g) venn diagrams indicates the numbers of overlapping and non-overlapping differentially regulated lincrnas in hiv-1 infected mdms infected and hiv-2 infected mdms compared to uninfected mdms red color indicates upregulation and green color indicates down regulation of lincrna expression respectively.full size imagedata from microarray analysis indicated that 199 lincrnas (185 upregulated and 14 downregulated) were differentially regulated in hiv-1 infected mdms and 189 lincrnas (178 upregulated and 11 downregulated) were differentially regulated in the hiv-2 infected mdms. inclusion criteria for upregulated or downregulated lincrnas were based on at least a 2 fold change in the modulation of their gene expression with a p-value of ≤ 0.05. the complete list of differentially regulated lincrnas from the hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms compared to uninfected control mdms is provided in supplementary table s1. a total of 151 upregulated lincrnas (fig. 1g) and one downregulated (fig. 1g) lincrna were found to be common in both hiv-1 and hiv-2 infection. thirty four lincrnas (fig. 1g) and 13 lincrnas (fig. 1g) were specifically upregulated and downregulated only in hiv-1 infected mdms respectively. similarly, 27 lincrnas were upregulated (fig. 1g) and 10 lincrnas were downregulated (fig. 1g) only in hiv-2 infected mdms.differential regulation of mrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2similar to changes in lincrna regulation pattern, data from microarray analysis identified modulation in the expression of several protein-coding genes that were specific to either hiv-1 or hiv-2 infection. hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes could readily be classified into two groups, i.e., the hiv-1 vs uninfected control group (fig. 2a) and hiv-2 vs uninfected control group (fig. 2b). figure 2c and d show the scatter plot for the differentially expressed mrnas compared to uninfected controls.figure 2analysis of differentially regulated mrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1, hiv-2 and uninfected controls.

(a,c) the bar plot shows fold enrichment value of the significant enrichment terms and pathway analysis for differentially expressed up regulated and down regulated genes in hiv-1 infected mdms respectively. (b,d) the bar plot shows fold enrichment value of the significant enrichment terms and pathway analysis for differentially expressed up regulated and down regulated genes in hiv-2 infected mdms respectively.full size imagekegg pathway analysis was used to investigate the biological pathways of the differentially regulated genes. in hiv-1 infected mdms, the differentially up regulated genes were mainly related to glutathione metabolism, lysine degradation and olfactory transduction (supplementary figure 1). in contrast, differentially up regulated genes in hiv-2 infected mdms were associated primarily with pathways involved in thyroid cancer, oocyte meiosis, nicotinate metabolism and spliceosome pathways (supplementary figure 2). no kegg pathways were identified to be enriched in the down regulated genes in hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms.validation of microarray results by qpcr and western blotto validate our microarray data, 8 lincrnas were randomly chosen from hiv-1/hiv-2 infected groups (supplementary table s1) for detection by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the validation results indicated that 7 lincrnas had the same pattern of expression in hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected mdms as that determined by microarray analysis (fig. 4). one lincrna; xloc_001148 showed only a 30% concordance with the microarray results in hiv-2 infected mdms. the inconsistency between the expression pattern of this lincrna identified by microarray and by qpcr may be a consequence of donor-to-donor variability that could impact virus infectivity. similarly, to validate our microarray data (supplementary table s2), a subset of differentially regulated genes (table 1) that demonstrated > 2 fold up or down regulation, coupled with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were selected for detection by qpcr. rt-pcr analysis using day-7 post infection rna, derived from hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms (table 1 and supplementary figure 3), demonstrates that the rna samples derived from multiple donors exhibited a consistent gene expression profile which corroborates the microarray results. in hiv-1 infected cells, cripi, and mbd5 genes were found to be up regulated (100% agreement with microarray data) and rnf157 and xpnpep3 found to be down regulated (100% agreement with microarray data) consistent with the gene expression profile detected by microarray analysis. genes gtf3c3 and fibin did not show a consistent pattern of gene expression among the hiv-1 infected mdms tested. in hiv-2 infected mdms, genes cep170, cul 2, ddx3x, pikfyve, rap2a, rbbp4 and srsf9 were found to be differentially up regulated, validating the microarray results (table 1 and supplementary figure 3). protein level changes of some validated differentially expressed mrnas were determined by western blot. we found that expression of cul 2 and rbbp4 were up-regulated in hiv-2 infected mdms compared with uninfected controls (fig. 5). the western blot results suggest that changes detected in the expression of proteins are consistent with microarray and rt-qpcr data. all validations were done with mdms isolated from three independent donors that were distinct from mdms used for the microarray analysis.figure 4qpcr validation of host lincrnas in mdms infected with hiv1 and hiv-2 day-7 post infection. the data represents results from 3 independent experiments. values are fold-change plotted on a log scale for hiv-1 (black) and hiv-2 (red) infected mdms relative to an uninfected control mdms. qpcr was normalized with the endogenous gapdh control and measured the relative amount of target gene. expression of fold change is calculated as n-fold difference in expression of gene-of-interest relative to gapdh gene for infected and uninfected cells as n-fold = 2^ − (δct infected −δct uninfected). each sample was run in triplicate to ensure accurate fold change estimation and the results expressed as mean ± sem.full size imagetable 1 selected differentially regulated genes in hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected mdms day-7 post infection.full size tablefigure 5real-time pcr detection of host genes and western blot detection of host proteins in hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected mdms day-7 post infection.

(b) western blot data depicts results from proteins isolated from a single donor. images of the western blots presented here are displayed in cropped format. full length blots are presented in supplementary figure 4. separate protein gels were run under the same experimental condition and processed in parallel. β-actin was used as a loading control. western blot data is representative of 3 independent experiments with mdms derived from 3 independent donors.full size imageconstruction of lincrna-mrna coexpression networka lincrna-mrna co-expression network (cnc network) was constructed based on the correlation analysis between the top 50 differentially expressed lincrnas vs all differentially expressed mrnas in hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms (supplementary tables s3 and s4). pearson correlation coefficients not less than 0.93 were selected to draw the network using the cytoscape 3.2.1 software. the lincrna-mrna co-expression network for hiv-1 infected mdms identified 237 network nodes associated with 314 edges (supplementary figure 5). in hiv-2 infected mdms, the lincrna-mrna co-expression network identified 143 network nodes that were associated with 243 network pairs (supplementary figure 6). the results from the cnc network indicated that a single differentially expressed mrna could correlate with one to ten differentially expressed lincrnas forming a large correlated network of lincrnas and host genes.identification of plasma lincrnas as candidate biomarkers for hiv-1 and hiv-2 infectionthere is an urgent need for the identification of novel and more efficient diagnostic methods based on host biomarkers for a better understanding of hiv-1 and hiv-2 pathogenesis and to devise effective treatment regimens. recently, many studies have demonstrated that circulatory long noncoding rna could serve as novel diagnostic markers for a variety of diseases. to determine whether the differentially expressed lincrnas identified in our microarray analysis could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for hiv-1/hiv-2 infection, expression levels of eight lincrnas, lincrna:chr2: 165509129-165519404, lincrna:chr10: 31600144-31607369, lincrna:chr10:128586385-128592960, xloc_001148, lincrna:chr11:29331349-29342299, lincrna:chr12:57761837-57762303, lincrna:chr5:87580664-87583451 and lincrna:chrx:37320554-37332754 in plasma specimens from hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected patients were compared to specimens from uninfected healthy subjects. one lincrna (lincrna: chrx: 37320554-37332754) out of the eight lincrnas tested, was not amplified and not included for further analysis. the qpcr results showed that compared to healthy controls, the expression of lincrna: chr2:165509129-165519404 was significantly upregulated in hiv-1 infected patients (p < 0.001) (fig. 6), while the expression of lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960 (p < 0.05), lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 (p < 0.0001) and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 (p < 0.001) were significantly downregulated in the hiv-1 infected patients (fig. 6). in hiv-2 infected patients xloc_001148 (p < 0.001) and lincrna: chr5: 87580664-87583451 (p < 0.001) lincrna were significantly elevated and lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960 was significantly downregulated (p < 0.001) compared to controls (fig. 6). no significant differences in the expression of lincrna: chr10: 31600144-31607369, xloc_001148 and lincrna: chr11: 29331349-29342299 were detected in hiv-1 infected patients compared with controls. similarly, no significant differences in the expression of lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404, lincrna: chr10: 31600144-31607369, lincrna: chr11:29331349-29342299 and lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 were detected in hiv-2 infected patients compared with controls. comparison between hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected patients demonstrated that xloc_001148 (p < 0.001), lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 (p < 0.001) and lincrna: chr5: 87580664-87583451 (p < 0.0001) were significantly elevated in only hiv-2 infected patients. furthermore, to evaluate the power of the 5 dysregulated lincrnas in detecting hiv-1 and hiv-2 infection, we performed receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis (table 2). the results showed that, the area under the curve (auc) was significantly larger for lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404 (0.9653; 95% ci: 0.9026 to 1.000), lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 (0.9514; 95% ci: 0.8699 to 1.000) and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 (0.0.7917; 95% ci: 0.6001 to 0.9832) (fig. 7a) in hiv-1 infected patients compared with healthy controls (table 2). the auc for lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960 was 0.8264 (95% ci = 0.6603 to 0.9925); the xloc_001148 auc was 0.850 (95% ci = 0.6885 to 1.000) and the lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 auc was 0.850 (95% ci = 0.6824 to 1.000) (fig. 7b); the aucs for these lincrnas were substantially higher than any other lincrnas in hiv-2 infected patients compared with healthy controls (table 2). comparison between the hiv-2 infected patient group with the hiv-1 infected patient group indicated that the auc was substantially larger for lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 (0.925; 95% ci: 0.8190 to 1.000), lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 (0.8403; 95% ci: 0.6510 to 1.030) and xloc_001148 (0.8917; 95% ci: 0.7560 to 1.000) (fig. 7c and table 2).figure 6the expression levels of lincrnas in plasma samples from hiv-1 infected patients, hiv-2 infected patients and healthy controls. results are expressed as relative expression and the expression was calculated as follows: δct target lincrna in infected sample = ct target lincrna in infected sample - ct gapdh in infected sample;

(a) hiv-1 infected patients vs healthy controls; (b) hiv-2 infected patients vs healthy controls; (c) hiv-2 vs hiv-1infected patients.full size imagediscussion in our study, microarray analysis was used to detect the expression profiles of lincrnas and mrnas in three independent donors of mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 and uninfected controls. our results identified many differentially expressed lincrnas and mrnas in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 compared to uninfected cells (figs 1 and 2). in total, 35% of the differentially regulated lincrnas were found in hiv-1 infected mdms and 29% of the differentially expressed lincrnas were found in hiv-2 infected mdms respectively, suggesting that these aberrantly expressed lincrnas play an important role in hiv pathogenesis. results indicate that more than 100 genes were upregulated in hiv-2 infected mdms, whereas, in hiv-1 infected mdms a far greater number of lincrnas and mrnas were down-regulated. these results imply that hiv-1 may promote intracellular survival by repressing the expression of genes that aid in viral restriction.to predict the potential functions of these differentially expressed mrnas, we carried out go analysis and kegg pathway analysis. analysis demonstrated that most of the enriched go terms and pathway terms were quite different between hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms. notably, very few enriched go terms and pathway terms were shared between hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms. these data suggest that hiv-1 and hiv-2 may evade host defences by using different pathways (fig. 3). regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization process, identified as an enriched go term in hiv-1 infected cells, is essential for regulating the expression of hiv-1 induced tnf receptor36 which creates an actin specific signaling cascade37 that leads to apoptosis of uninfected bystander t cells and to the sustained viral replication in infected macrophages36. interestingly, glutathione metabolism pathway that synthesizes glutathione, also identified as an enriched kegg pathway in hiv-1 infected cells, plays an important role in antioxidant defense in cells38. altering the glutathione metabolism pathway may lead to glutathione redox in hiv-1 infected macrophages promoting infection39. our microarray and validation results have determined that snrnp40, srsf9, tra2a genes were up regulated in hiv-2 infected mdms compared to uninfected controls. these genes serve as key regulatory molecules of spliceosome pathways which were also identified as enriched go terms in hiv-2 infected cells. it has been reported that hiv-1 virus replication was inhibited by promoting excessive splicing of hiv-1 rna in t cells40. hiv-2 may up regulate nuclear mrna splicing related genes like srsf9 through the spliceosome pathway to prevent host defense mechanisms. in addition, we found that host genes, cul 2 and rbbp4 were up regulated in hiv-2 infection only. cul 2 is a member of the cullin family and serves as a scaffold protein for elongin b and c, rbx1 and various other substrate recognition receptors to form the cullin-ring e3 ubiquitin ligase complex41. in addition, previously we found that cul-2 was up-regulated in hiv-2 infected jurkat cells29. thus, we speculate that hiv-2 could induce host proteins like cul 2 which can interact with viral proteins functioning as an e3 ubiquitin ligase to induce the polyubiquitination of host antiviral proteins leading to their degradation. in hiv-1 infected cells, cul-5, a member of the cullin family, interacts with hiv-1 protein vif and functions as an e3 ubiquitin ligase to induce polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of host antiviral protein apobec3g42, thereby promoting hiv-1 infection. rbbp4, also known as nurf55, is a component of several chromatin-related complexes like nurd and caf-143. it is known that nurd complex represses tat-mediated transactivation of the hiv-1 ltr in t lymphocytes, pointing to a potential role in the initiation of hiv-1 silencing44. it is possible that up regulation of rbbp4 protein and the nurd complex may play a role in the generation of a silenced state of chromatin on the integrated hiv-2 promoter.the complex modes of action and great abundance make lincrnas an attractive target to study. most pathogens like hiv-1 are adept at altering host gene expression profiles in their favor by controlling replication, transcription, and/or translation processes. in fact, few existing reports suggest a role of lncrnas in activation of hiv-1 replication and subsequent increase in virus production45,46,47. recently, nair, et al. employed microarray analysis to detect the expression profile of lncrnas and associated mrnas in active vs latent hiv-1 infection. the authors revealed that lncrnas were differentially expressed in u-937 monocytes infected with hiv-1 and suggest that these transcripts may play an important role in regulating the host immune response to hiv-1 infection48. another study by saayman, et al. showed that hiv-1 encoded antisense lncrnas can epigenetically control hiv-1 transcription49. interestingly, zhang, et al. found that lncrna sra was downregulated in both jurkat and mt4 cells47 infected with hiv-1. studies have indicated that lincrnas may play a role in apoptosis. lincrna-p21 is a p53-induced large intergenic noncoding rna which influences the p53 tumor suppressor pathway by acting in cis as a locus-restricted co-activator for p53-mediated p21 expression. lincrna-p21 knockdown reduced the effect of p53 mediated apoptosis50,51. a recent study suggests that hiv-1 succeeds in inhibiting lincrna-p21 and the p53 induced apoptotic pathway by activating the map2k1/erk2 pathway, thereby promoting disease progression and viral replication6. other, long noncoding rnas, neat1 and norn were upregulated in hiv-1 infected cells46,47,52. in this study, we discovered that many lincrnas were differentially regulated in mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2, indicating that lincrnas might play an important role in the host response to hiv infection.based on the cnc analysis of the top 50 lincrnas and differentially expressed mrnas in mdms, we found significant correlations between lincrnas and multiple protein coding genes. the reported co-expression analysis that predicts interactions between mrnas and lincrnas were derived from bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed mrnas and lincrnas and no direct evidence is presented to substantiate these predictions. additional gene expression profiling experiments after overexpression or knockdown of specific lincrnas would be necessary to validate the predicted interactions between lincrnas and mrnas. nevertheless, the cnc analysis data suggests that lincrnas can impact the transcriptional regulation of mrna expression both in cis and in trans53,54. cnc analysis indicated that many lincrnas exert their functions through predicted mrna interactions. for example, we found that lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 was associated with tripartite-motif containing protein 52 (trim 52) that has antiviral properties (supplementary table s4). trim 52, exerts its antiviral activity by degrading viral proteins through their e3 ligase activity or by promoting host innate immunity55,56,57,58. we also observed a coexistence phenomenon of lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 and snf2 histone linker phd ring helicase (shprh) gene. shprh belongs to the ring family of proteins, involved in dna repair and immunoglobulin diversification59. we speculate that lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 may protect host genomic dna by degrading the viral proteins through the regulation of shprh and trim 52. validation results indicated that eight lincrnas were consistent with the microarray data.in addition to exploring the function of target genes of the lincrnas, we expanded the scope of our study to determine whether the lincrnas were differentially regulated in plasma from hiv-1 infected patients, hiv-2 infected patients, and healthy controls. the detection of circulating nucleic acids in cell-free plasma, serum, and other body fluids60,61 has been well documented. plasma is comparatively easy to obtain and provides new opportunities to develop novel diagnostic or prognostic markers in hiv-1/hiv-2 infection. several reports have shown that lincrnas or mirnas can stably exist in plasma and may be protected by macrovesicles, exosome encapsulation, and apoptotic bodies62,63. therefore, lincrnas can serve as promising host based biomarkers for diagnosis of diverse hiv variants. in this study, we found 5 lincrnas, lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404, lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960, xloc_001148, lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451, that were significantly aberrantly expressed in plasma samples from patients with hiv-1/hiv-2 infection in comparison with healthy donors (fig. 6). we further performed roc analysis to evaluate the power of these 5 lincrnas to differentiate between hiv-1 and hiv-2 infected patients from healthy donors as well as to discriminate hiv-2 patients from hiv-1 patients in our cohort. the data indicated that auc of lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404 and lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 were over 0.9, while that of lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 was lower than 0.8, (fig. 7) which indicates that lincrna: chr2: 165509129-165519404 and lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 may function as better candidate host biomarkers for hiv-1 diagnosis. based on the expression levels as well as auc of these lincrnas; lincrna: chr10:128586385-128592960, xloc_001148 and lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451 might be potential host biomarkers for diagnosis of hiv-2 infection (table 2). our data also showed differences in lincrna: chr5:87580664-87583451, lincrna: chr12:57761837-57762303 and xloc_001148 expression signatures between hiv-1/hiv-2 (table 2), and these 3 lincrnas could serve as potential diagnostic host biomarkers to differentiate between hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patients. although, age and sex could have an impact on the expression of the differentially expressed plasma lincrnas that were identified, confounder effects like age and sex were not taken into consideration during analysis. in this study, our focus was to compare samples from hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patients with samples from un-infected control subjects to identify differentially regulated host factors in response to hiv-1/hiv-2 infection. in future studies, it would be necessary to investigate differentially expressed host factors in larger cohorts factoring other variables like age and sex.as previously reported, using microarray techniques and subsequent validation by rt-pcr and western blotting, we identified several host mrnas that were differentially expressed in pbmcs infected with hiv-1/ hiv-228. in the current report, we have extended our in vitro studies to delineate the differential regulation of host mrnas and long intergenic non-coding rnas in hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms. furthermore, in the current study we have identified circulatory lincrnas in plasma samples from hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patients that may serve as biomarkers of infection. we believe that this is the first report that has comprehensively analyzed and identified both lincrnas and host mrnas that are differentially regulated in hiv-1/hiv-2 infected mdms.these differentially expressed lincrnas and mrnas might be crucial for regulating the antiviral mechanisms of macrophages. more importantly, we have determined that three lincrnas may have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic host biomarkers for discrimination between hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patient samples. further validation of these host biomarkers in hiv-1/hiv-2 infection is necessary. we plan to expand this investigation with a larger sample size to verify the identification of the lincrnas and mrnas and determine the impact of hiv-1 subtypes on pathogenesis and disease progression.materials and methodsisolation and differentiation of monocytes into monocyte derived macrophages (mdms)human monocytes isolated from pbmc after leukophoresis (buffy coats) of donors seronegative for both hiv-1 and hepatitis b and purified by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation64 were provided by the national institutes of health (nih) blood bank. nih ethics committee approved this protocol to use deidentified samples of blood and /or blood products originally obtained under the nih irb-approved protocol and consent form (study number: 99-cc-0168, pi: susan f. leitman, m.d.). the cells were re-suspended in culture medium containing dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem) (quality biologicals, usa) supplemented with 10% fbs, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin/ml. after 2 hour of incubation, non-adherent cells were removed and adherent monocytes were cultured for 5–7 days in the presence of 0.02 µg/ml macrophage colony stimulation factor (mcsf, cat#phc9504, thermo fisher) at density of 106 cells/ml. cells were judged by morphological examination and found that more than 98% cells were macrophages.plasma samplesa total of 24 edta plasma samples from hiv-1/hiv-2 infected patients were used for this study. twelve samples were from hiv-1 infected patients and 12 samples were from hiv-2 infected patients. all samples were purchased from commercial vendors. all plasma specimens were characterized using commercially available fda-approved/licensed nucleic acid or antibody assays by the vendor. control plasma samples from donors seronegative for hiv-1, hepatitis b and hepatitis c were obtained from the nih blood bank.mdms infection with virusesadherent mdms were infected with equivalent amounts of 5ng/ml hiv-1 p24 units/million cells of hiv-1 ba-l (clade b)65 (cat# 510, nih aids reagent) and 5ng/ml siv p27 units/million cells of hiv-2 (rod) (cat#

time-points were used to quantitate hiv-1 p24 antigen using nen/dupont elisa analysis kit (cat# nek050b00, perkin elmer). hiv-2 p26 quantification was done using retro-tek siv p27 antigen elisa kit (cat# 22-156-775, zeptometrix).rna isolation and quality controltotal rna was extracted as describe earlier [ref] from infected and uninfected mdms pellets using mirneasy total rna isolation kit (cat# 217004, qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. total rna from each sample was measured using nanodrop nd-1000. rna integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and bioanalyser 2100.agilent microarray analysis of lncrna and mrna expressionagilent sureprint g3 human gene expression 8 × 60 k microarray hybridization and analysis were carried out by arraystar inc. rockville, md. this array contains 7,419 lincrnas probes and 27,958 coding transcript probes, and was constructed using most authoritative public transcriptome database (e.g., refseq, ensemble, unigene, genbank, etc.). the rna samples that passed quality control test were used for the further experiments. the agilent array platform was used for the microarray analysis. the sample preparations, microarray hybridization, slide washing and scanning were performed according to the standard protocols as previously described28.gene ontology (go) and pathway analysisgo analysis was used to investigate biological functions based on differentially expressed coding genes. this analysis classifies functions according to the three following aspects: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. fisher’s exact test was applied to classify the go category. the p-value denotes the significance of go term enrichment in the differentially regulated genes. the lower the p-value signified more the go term (p value < 0.05). pathway analysis was used to investigate the differentially expressed coding genes according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg). the p-value (ease-score, fisher-p value or hypergeometric-p value) indicates the significance of the pathway correlated with the conditions.  p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.cdna synthesis and quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr)rna samples derived from 3 independent donors were used as templates to validate the microarray results.real-time pcr was performed to determine the expression profile of selected mrnas using qiagen custom pcr array plates with sybr-green and rox (cat # 330503 qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.total rna from uninfected and infected mdms was reverse transcribed with superscript iii first-strand synthesis supermix (cat # 18080400, thermofisher). the resulting cdna was then amplified by using lincrna specific primers and gapdh as endogenous control for each donor using sybr green chemistry (cat# a25741 thermofisher) as previously discussed28. three independent biological replicates were tested along with three technical replicates for each treatment. melting curves were analyzed to examine the specificity of amplification. relative gene expression was calculated by the standard δδct method.construction of lincrna-mrna coexpression networkthe lincrna-mrna coexpression network was constructed as per yu et al.66, using a modified pearson correlated coefficient (pcc) cut off. the pearson correlated coefficients were calculated and lincrna-mrna pairs were selected that had a pearson correlated coefficient (pcc) ≥ 0.93 the cnc network was created using cytoscape 3.2.1. pink nodes represent lincrnas, blue nodes represent mrnas. red solid lines indicate a positive correlation, while the blue equal dashed line indicates a negative correlation.western blot analysisvalidation of mrna (cul2 and rbbp4) expression at the protein level was performed by western blot. mdms infected with hiv-1/hiv-2 and uninfected controls, cultured for 7 days post infection were collected by scrapping followed by centrifugation. proteins were extracted with ripa buffer (cat # 89901, thermo scientific) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (cat # 4693159001, sigma-aldrich). equal amount of proteins (5 µg) were used in the western blot experiment as described earlier28 with m cul 2 monoclonal antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., cat # sc-166506)67, rbbp4 monoclonal antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., cat # sc-373873)68 and β-actin monoclonal antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., cat # sc-47778)69. ecl western blotting analysis system (cat # rpn2108, ge healthcare) was used to visualize the proteins.statistical analysisall results were presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (sem) of three independent experiments. differences in lincrna levels between hiv-1/hiv-2 and control groups were analyzed using unpaired student t-test. receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis was used to evaluate the power of each candidate biomarker. the statistical analysis was performed using the spss 16.0 and graphpad prism 5.0 software. all of the statistical tests were two tailed, p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically

Effects of HIV on executive function and verbal fluency in Cameroon,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36193-7,Research,12 December 2018,yes,"hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand) are frequently associated with impaired executive function and verbal fluency. given limited knowledge concerning hand in sub-saharan-africa and lack of cameroonian adult neuropsychological (np) test norms, we administered four executive function [halstead category test (hct), wisconsin card sorting test (wcst), color trails-ii (ctt2), and stroop color-word-interference (scwt)] and three verbal fluency (category, action, and letter fluency) tests to 742 adult cameroonians (395 hiv−, 347 hiv+). we developed demographically-corrected np test norms and examined the effects of hiv and related variables on subjects’ executive function and verbal fluency. hiv+ subjects had significantly lower t-scores on ctt2 (p = 0.005), hct (p = 0.032), wcst (p < 0.001); lower executive function composite (p = 0.002) and action fluency (p = 0.03) t-scores. art, viremia, and cd4 counts did not affect t-scores. compared to cases harboring other viral subtypes, subjects harboring hiv-1 crf02_ag had marginally higher ctt2 t-scores, significantly higher scwt (p = 0.015) and executive function (p = 0.018) t-scores. thus, hiv-1 infection in cameroon is associated with impaired executive function and some aspects of verbal fluency, and viral genotype influenced executive function. we report the first normative data for assessing executive function and verbal fluency in adult cameroonians and provide regression-based formulas for computing demographically-adjusted t-scores. these norms will be useful for investigating hiv/aids and other diseases affecting cognitive functioning in cameroon.
introduction hiv enters the cns in the early stages of infection, where it productively infects brain macrophages and microglia and can induce injury and dysfunction of neurons and other cns cells1,2. these brain pathologies frequently result in behavioral, motor and cognitive abnormalities referred to as hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand)2,3,4,5,6. studies in western countries show that although combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) use has reduced the prevalence of hiv-associated dementia (the most severe form of hand), the prevalence of milder forms of hand such as asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ani) and mild neurocognitive disorders (mnd) have not improved in the cart era4,5,6,7,8,9,10.our current knowledge of hand prevalence and pathogenesis is mostly derived from studies performed in western countries, using subjects infected with subtype-b hiv-12,4,5,6,7,8,11,12. since the beginning of the hiv/aids epidemic over 3 decades ago, sub-saharan africa (ssa) has consistently been the hardest hit region in the world, and most of the 35 million people who have died from hiv/aids-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic were in ssa. of the 36.7 million individuals worldwide currently living with hiv/aids, 70% are in ssa13, many with non-b viral subtypes, and there is little information concerning whether these individuals are at risk for cognitive and neurological complications.like most countries in ssa, cameroon, a country of about 25 million inhabitants14, still has a heavy hiv/aids burden. according to recent unaids estimates, the prevalence of hiv infection in the general adult population in cameroon is 3.8%, with a prevalence of 5.1% among adult females, 2.5% among adult males, 24.3% among female sex workers, and 37.2% among men who have sex with men15. the hiv epidemic in cameroon is further characterized by a high viral genetic diversity, with circulating strains including several group m hiv-1 subtypes, hiv-1 groups o and n, circulating recombinant forms and unique recombinant forms16,17,18. therefore, it is important to understand the neurological and neurocognitive effects of the various forms of hiv infection in this country.it has been shown that the cognitive domains most likely impaired in hiv/aids patients include executive function3,5,19,20,21,22 and verbal fluency5,23,24. the executive function domain includes cognitive abilities involved in life tasks such as planning, organizing and strategizing, management, paying attention, mental control, and self-regulation25,26. the verbal fluency domain includes cognitive abilities involved in language and semantic memory, including word knowledge and retrieval27,28,29. executive function and verbal fluency are both supported by the frontal lobes, and impairments in these cognitive domains correlate with damage to frontal brain systems27,30,31,32. these cognitive abilities are assessed using neuropsychological (np) tests. however, using np tests to assess cognitive abilities in any given population requires normative data appropriate to that population, in order to ensure validity, accurate classification and clinical diagnoses. some norms for cognitive evaluation of children were previously reported in cameroon and used to assess cognitive function in children with sickle cell disease33,34. currently there are no adult cameroonian norms for assessing executive function or verbal fluency. our current study establishes normative scores for four commonly used np tests of executive function: the halstead category test (hct), wisconsin card sorting test (wcst), color trails-ii test (ctt2), and stroop color-word interference test (scwt)25,35,36,37,38,39; and three commonly used np tests of verbal fluency: category fluency, action fluency, and letter fluency27,28,29,30. we adjusted the data for demographic factors (age, gender, and education), and further assessed the effects of hiv infection, immune status, art, viremia and viral genotype on subjects’ performance on these np tests.resultsdemographic and laboratory characteristicsin 2016, an estimated 560,000 cameroonians were living with hiv/aids, and 29,000 hiv/aids-related deaths were recorded14,15. females represented about 65% of hiv-infected adults (15 to 49 years old), and 70% of hiv-infected youths and younger adults (15 to 24 years old)14,15. a total of 742 subjects were recruited for this study, including 395 hiv-seronegative controls and 347 hiv+ cases. overall, hiv+ subjects were somewhat older, less educated, and had a smaller proportion of males than the control group (table 1). the median cd4 cell counts in the hiv+ cohort was 407 (iqr 246, 574) cells/µl. for the 173 cases with detectable viral load, the mean log viral load was 4.59 ± 1.28 log copies/ml. for the 343 cases with known treatment status, 189 (55.1%) were on cart, of whom 139 (73.5%) had undetectable viral load; 148 (43.1%) were treatment naïve, of whom 34 (23%) had undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) (table 1). six cases (1.75%) had stopped cart and/or took cart only for a short period (e.g. during pregnancy) (table 1). many subjects could not complete the neuromedical, np battery, and lab tests on the same day, and had to return to the hospital on a different day for specimen collection and lab testing. some of those subjects did not return for lab testing, resulting in 9.5% missing lab data. additionally, 7 participants (2%) had missing cd4 (3 participants) or viral load (4 participants), which apparently was due to the relevant equipment not being fully operational at the time of specimen collection.table 1 demographic and clinical characteristics by hiv status. values are mean (sd), median [iqr], or n (%).full size tableraw

function (ctt2, hct, scwt, and wcst) and verbal fluency (category fluency, action fluency, and letter fluency) tests, using regression-based analyses. for both samples (hiv− and hiv+) robust age and education effects were seen on raw scores for all the tests, and for gender on most tests. in every case (all tests for both samples), education and gender effects were absent in the corrected t-scores. age effects were fully controlled on t-scores for the hiv− samples, and either fully controlled (ctt2, wcst, executive function composite) or greatly attenuated in the t-scores of the hiv+ sample. all significant hiv effects on t-scores and deficit scores remained significant if age was covaried in the relevant analyses.table 2 conversion of the raw scores to scaled scores for tests

errors, and wcst total errors (table 4). there was no group difference in stroop interference t-scores, but a significantly lower executive function composite t-score was seen for hiv+ subjects compared to seronegative controls (table 4).table 4 comparisons of executive function and verbal fluency demographically-corrected t-scores between controls and hiv+ patients. notes: cohen’s d

showed impairment on the ctt2 (odds ratio (or) 2.53) and wcst (or:1.94) (p < 0.001, table 5). there was no significant difference between the two groups in impairment rates on the hct and scwt, but analysis of the composite executive function domain deficit score showed that the proportion of hiv+ subjects with impairment in executive functioning (20.2%) was almost double the proportion seen in hiv− controls (12%) (p = 0.007, table 5).table 5 comparisons of the proportions of impairment in executive function and verbal fluency domains between controls and hiv+ patients.full size tableeffects of hiv infection on verbal fluencycompared to controls, hiv+ subjects had significantly lower t-scores in the test of action fluency (p = 0.03), but there was no difference between the two groups on category fluency, letter fluency, or the composite verbal fluency t-scores (table 4). analyses of the prevalence of impairment in verbal fluency showed that compared to hiv− controls, a significantly higher proportion of hiv+ subjects had impairment in action fluency (p = 0.001), and again there was no significant difference between the two groups on category fluency or letter fluency (table 5). however, the analysis that considered all tests of the verbal fluency domain together (domain deficit score) showed impairment in 23.8% of hiv+ subjects, compared to 12.9% for the hiv− controls group (p < 0.001, table 5).effects of viremia on executive function and verbal fluencyto determine whether viral load affected executive functioning and/or verbal fluency in hiv+ participants, we compared t-scores of those with undetectable (<50 viral copies/ml, n = 173) and detectable (≥50 copies/ml, n = 132) viral loads. data showed no significant difference in ctt2, hct, scwt, and wcst t-scores between the two groups, and no difference in the overall executive function composite score between virally suppressed cases (undetectable) and cases with detectable viral loads (d: 0.03; 95% ci: −0.28, 0.22, p = 0.81). additional analyses comparing cases having undetectable viral loads (<50 copies/ml, n = 173) with participants having viral loads >50 and <100,000 copies/ml (n = 80), and cases with very high viral loads (≥ 100,000 copies/ml) (n = 51) also showed no group differences on individual executive function scores, and no difference on the overall executive function composite t-score. data also revealed no effect of viral loads on category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, or the overall verbal fluency t-scores.effects of cart on executive function and verbal fluencyto determine whether antiretroviral treatment could affect patients executive functioning and/or verbal fluency, we performed comparative analyses of t-scores of hiv+ subjects who were treatment naïve and those on cart. analyses showed that patients on cart had marginally higher scwt t-scores compared to participants not on cart (d: 0.19; 95% ci: 0.03, 0.42, p = 0.09), but no differences were found on ctt2, hct, and wcst t-scores, and no difference in the overall executive function composite t-score between subjects not on treatment and those on cart. similarly, cart had no effect on category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, and no effect on the overall verbal fluency composite t-scores, although marginal significance was observed for letter fluency and verbal fluency composite t-scores (d: 0.20; 95% ci: −0.02, 0.43, p = 0.07 and d: 0.19; 95% ci: −0.03, 0.41, p = 0.09, respectively).of the 189 cases on cart, 177 (93.65%) were on first line regimens; only 12 (6.3%) had been on regimens that included a second line cart: 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis) or 2nrtis + 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrt), plus lopinavir/ritonavir (lpv/r, n = 7), atazanavir/ritonavir (atv/r, n = 3), or darunavir/ritonavir (drv/r n = 2). of the 177 cases on first line regimens, 123 (69.5%) were on lamivudine (3tc) + zidovudine (zdv)+ nevirapine (npv) or efavirenz (efv); and 64 (36.16%) were on 3tc + tenofovir (tdf) + nvp or efv. we performed additional analyses of cases on regimens containing nvp (n = 91) or zdv (n = 68 to 75) and cases on regimens that did not contain nvp (non-nvp, n = 47 to 58) or zdv (non-zdv, n = 55 to 64). compared to the non-nvp group, use of nvp was associated with marginally higher t-scores on ctt2 (d: 0.32; 95% ci: −0.026, 0.67, p = 0.07). there were no significant differences in hct, scwt, and wcst t-scores, and no difference in the overall executive function composite t-scores between the non-nvp and nvp groups. there were no differences in the category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, or the overall verbal fluency composite t-scores of the non-nvp and nvp groups. there were no significant differences in ctt2, hct, scwt, and wcst t-scores, or the overall executive function composite t-scores of the zdv and non-zdv groups; no differences in the category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, or the overall verbal fluency composite t-scores of the zdv and non-zdv groups.compared to cases that had been on multiple (≥2) cart regimens (n = 46 to 51), cases that been on only one cart regimen (n = 110 to 125) had marginally higher hct t-scores (d: 0.31; 95% ci: −0.01, 0.64, p = 0.06). there were no differences on cct2, scwt, and wcst t-scores, or the overall executive function composite t-scores of cases that had only one cart regimen and those that had been on multiple cart regimens. there were no differences in the category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, or the overall verbal fluency composite t-scores of cases that had been on only one regimen and those that had been on multiple cart regimens.effects of the immune system on executive function and verbal fluencyto determine whether the immune status could affect executive functioning or verbal fluency among cameroonian subjects, we compared analyses of t-scores of hiv+ subjects with low (<350 cells/µl) and higher (≥350 cells/µl) cd4 cell counts. analyses showed no significant difference in ctt2 (d: 0.12; 95% ci: −0.11, 0.36, p = 0.30), hct (d: 0.18; 95% ci: −0.06, 0.42, p = 0.15), scwt (d: 0.12; 95% ci: −0.12, 0.36, p = 0.32), wcst (d: 0.18; 95% ci: −0.06, 0.42, p = 0.14), or executive function composite t-scores (d: 0.20; 95% ci: −0.05, 0.46, p = 0.12).analyses showed no significant difference in category fluency (d: 0.06; 95% ci: −0.18, 0.30, p = 0.63), action fluency (d: 0.05; 95% ci: −0.18, 0.29, p = 0.65), letter fluency (d: 0.15; 95% ci: −0.08, 0.39, p = 0.22), or the summary verbal fluency (d: 0.10; 95% ci: −0.14, 0.33, p = 0.42) t-scores of cases with lower and those with higher cd4 cell counts.genetic diversity of cameroon hiv isolateswe successfully amplified the protease (pr), reverse transcriptase (rt), group specific antigen (gag), envelope (env, c2v3), transactivator of transcription (tat), and/or negative regulatory factor (nef) genes in plasma samples from 161 hiv+ cameroonians. combined analyses of the pr, rt, gag, env, tat, and/or nef sequences showed that hiv-1 crf02_ag was the predominant viral subtype, with 95 (59%) of the 161 subjects infected with this viral strain. genetic analyses of pr, rt, gag, env, tat, and/or nef sequences also showed multiple genetic recombinants. twenty four subjects (14.9%) harbored viruses that had crf02_ag genotype in some viral gene regions, and a different genotype in other regions: 4 crf02_ag/f2, 3 crf02_ag/crf01_ae, 3 crf02_ag/d, 2 crf02_ag/crf11_cpx, 2 g/crf02_ag, 2 crf02_ag/crf22_01a1, and 1 subject each for crf22_01a1/crf02_ag/crf01_ae, crf02_ag/a1, f1/crf02_ag, a1/ad/crf02_ag/crf09_cpx, crf02_ag/crf19_cpx, crf02_ag/crf18_cpx, and u(unclassified)/d/crf02_ag. forty two subjects (26.1%) were infected with non-crf02_ag strains, including subjects harboring viruses of a specific subtype in one or more of the six gene regions analyzed, and a different subtype in other regions: 7 crf37_cpx, 7 crf11_cpx; 3 each for crf13_cpx, crf18_cpx, crf01_ae, subtype g, subtype f2, and subtype d; 1 each for g/a1, crf11_cpx/a1, crf01_ae/crf22_01a1, a1/h, crf22_01a2/crf01_ae/crf22_01a1, crf19_cpx, crf37_cpx/a1, g/crf11_cpx, a1/a2/crf01_ae, crf22_01a1.effects of hiv genotype on executive function and verbal fluencyto explore whether viral genotype may influence subjects’ executive functioning or verbal fluency, we performed comparative analyses of t-scores of cases infected with hiv-1 crf02_ag (ag), the predominant subtype in cameroon, and cases infected with non-crf02_ag viruses (non-ag) or viruses that had crf02_ag genotype in some of the 6 gene regions analyzed and different genotypes in other gene regions (ag-plus). compared to ag subjects, non-ag and ag-plus subjects had marginally lower t-scores on ctt2 (d: 0.31; 95% ci: −0.02, 0.64, p = 0.058) and significantly lower t-scores on scwt (d: 0.41; 95% ci: 0.08, 0.74, p = 0.015). there were no significant differences between the two groups on the hct (d: 0.11; 95% ci: −0.23, 0.45, p = 0.53) and wcst (d: 0.18; 95% ci: −0.15, 0.52, p = 0.29) t-scores. analysis of the composite executive function t-scores showed that compared to ag subjects, non-ag and ag-plus subjects had significantly lower overall executive function composite t-scores (d: 0.43; 95% ci: 0.07, 0.78, p = 0.018). there was no difference between the two groups on category fluency, action fluency, or letter fluency t-scores, or the verbal fluency summary t-scores.discussion performances on neurocognitive tests are influenced by population demographics, language, and cultural backgrounds6,40,41. therefore, it is important to have population-appropriate, demographically-corrected normative standards to permit validity, accurate classification, and clinical diagnoses of neurocognitive disorders11. the present study provides the first reported adult normative data for assessing executive function and verbal fluency in cameroon. it provides demographically-corrected normative scores based upon results of healthy hiv− controls for four tests of executive function (ctt2, hct, wcst, and scwt) and three tests of verbal fluency (category fluency, action fluency, and letter fluency), as well as demographically-corrected norms for executive function and verbal fluency composites. we further performed comparative analyses of executive functioning and verbal fluency between the hiv− controls and hiv+ groups. analyses using demographically corrected standardized scores showed significant effects of hiv infection on executive function, with hiv+ subjects having significantly lower t-scores on ctt2, hct, and wcst compared to the control group; and 26.9% and 25.6% of cases showing deficits on ctt2 and wcst compared to 12.7 and 15.1% of controls. combining data for all four executive function tests further showed significantly higher proportion of cases with impairment in executive functioning (20.2%) compared to controls (12%). these findings are in agreement with previous studies in both developed4,5,6,7,8 and resource-limited9,42,43,44,45,46 countries showing that hiv infection was associated with impairments in executive function, including studies in uganda42,43,44, botswana45, and nigeria46.of the three np tests assessing the verbal fluency domain, the action fluency test was more sensitive for detecting differences between cases and controls, with 24.5% of cases showing impairment in action fluency compared to 14% of controls (p = 0.001). other studies previously showed greater impairment in action fluency than in category fluency among hiv+ subjects47,48; also compared to infected subjects with deficits in category fluency or letter fluency, deficits in action fluency in hiv+ subjects is associated with larger decline in activities of daily living49 and increased levels of astrocytosis markers in the cerebrospinal fluid50.other studies in ssa, including in south africa51, uganda44, and nigeria46 also found an hiv effect on verbal fluency, with the three tests of verbal fluency showing differential sensitivity. the south african study showed significant deficits in letter fluency and action fluency among hiv+ subjects compared to hiv− controls, and no difference in category (animal) fluency51; whereas the ugandan study showed significant hiv-related deficits in category (animal recall) fluency44, and another study in nigeria reported no significant differences at all in verbal fluency between hiv+ subjects and seronegative controls52. this suggests that the sensitivity of each of these 3 tests of verbal fluency may vary based on populations and cultural backgrounds. however, in most of these studies, analyses of summary verbal fluency scores showed a significant deficit in verbal fluency among hiv+ subjects compared to hiv− controls44,46,51. this agrees with our current findings showing that, after correction for demographic variables (age, education, gender), a significantly higher proportion of hiv+ subjects had deficits in the verbal fluency domain (23.8%) compared to hiv− controls (12.9%).verbal fluency tests assess individuals’ abilities to correctly search and retrieve a limited set of words28,29. like executive function tests, they require planning, organization, flexibility and decision-making. coordination with different brain areas, including the frontal and temporal systems, is required to correctly execute these tests27,28,29,30. as a measure of language and executive function, action fluency is most associated with frontal brain systems whereas letter fluency is associated with different networks of the brain frontal region, and category fluency more with temporo-parietal areas27,30,53,54. the fact that hiv-infected subjects in our current study showed deficits in both executive function and action fluency suggests that hiv infection may especially cause frontal system dysfunctions in the cameroonian population.it is well known that psychoactive substances and social drugs such as alcohol and nicotine can affect neurocognitive functioning, and previous studies in cameroon showed that for hiv+ subjects, alcohol use and smoking were associated with increased viral loads and oxidative stress55,56. it is unlikely that such confounds could have influenced our current data. as detailed in our inclusion/exclusion criteria in the methods section, we screened all subjects for social drugs (alcohol and nicotine-cotinine) and twelve other psychoactive substances, including cocaine, oxycodone, opiates, barbiturates, marijuana (tetrahydrocannabinol, thc), and methamphetamine. no subject tested positive for cocaine, oxycodone, or opiates, and breathalyzer tests showed that no subject tested had alcohol in their system. only one subject (hiv+) tested positive for methamphetamine; 3 (2 hiv+ and 1 hiv−) tested positive for thc, 4 (3 hiv+ and 1 hiv−) tested positive for barbiturates, and 17 (2.3%) (8 hiv+ and 9 hiv−) tested positive for nicotine-cotinine. these low numbers make it quite unlikely that substance use/abuse was a confounding factor in our current analyses.our current study showed that use of cart was associated with marginally higher scwt t-scores. however, there was no effect of cart or viral loads on other tests of executive function, or on the executive function summary t-score, or verbal fluency (category fluency, action fluency, and letter fluency, or the verbal fluency summary t-score). nvp and efv were the nnrtis used in cart regimens, and use of regimens containing nvp was associated with marginally higher t-scores on ctt2. these findings suggest that non-nvp (efv) regimens may have been slightly more likely to negatively affect at least some aspects of executive function, which corroborate other literature evidences showing that efv is neurotoxic and is associated with increased risk of cns adverse events and neurocognitive impairment57,58,59,60. we previously showed increased prevalence of depressive symptoms among hiv-infected cameroonians61, showed that changes in cart regimens were associated with increased risk of non-adherence to treatment and that the presence of depressive symptoms correlated with non-adherence to cart62. our current data also showed that, compared to subjects who had been on only one cart regimen, use of multiple cart regimens or changes in treatment regimens was associated with poorer performance in hct. changes in cart regimens are often due to virologic failure with the prior regimens, and our current data suggest that individuals with such changes may be more prone to executive dysfunction.we found no effect of cd4 counts on performance in executive function or verbal fluency tests. these results are different from findings in other settings showing that untreated hiv infection and high viremia were associated with increased risk of neurocognitive impairments63,64, and that cart use and viral control lowers the risk neurocognitive dysfunction64,65,66,67,68. studies of hiv+ subjects in other resource-limited countries, including in ssa67,69,70, showed that cart use was associated with improved cognitive function, with 6 months to 1 year cart associated with significantly better executive function and verbal fluency in south africa69 and uganda70. large variations in duration of cart use may have played a role in the discrepancies observed. whereas all cases in the ugandan70 and south african69 studies had respectively been on cart for 6 months and 1 year, hiv+ subjects on treatment in our study had been on cart for a median duration of 3.3 years (iqr: 1.5 to 6 years). a randomized clinical trial of 860 hiv+ subjects from seven resource-limited countries (in ssa, asia, and south america) who were regularly followed up for 4 years also showed no significant improvement in category fluency over 4 years cart, although it showed significant improvements in other cognitive domains such as complex motor function67. our subsequent studies will determine whether art and viremia affect other neurocognitive domains in hiv+ cameroonians.although hiv does not infect neurons, viral and cell-mediated factors from productively infected cns cells such as brain macrophages and microglia induce neuronal injury and death, leading to hand71,72,73. inflammation plays a major role in hand pathogenesis74,75,76, and hiv-1 virions, as well as viral proteins such as tat and gp120, induce the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines on the human brain endothelium, resulting in endothelial injury and bbb dysfunction, as well as increased infiltration of virions and infected cells into the cns and neuronal injury77,78,79,80. we previously showed differential effects of viral genotypes in hiv-1-induced bbb inflammation, with significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to hiv-1 crf02_ag tat proteins, compared to cells exposed to subtype b tat proteins81,82. hiv-1 crf02_ag is the predominant subtype in cameroon and other west and central african countries16,17,18. considering this differential inflammation with hiv-1 crf02_ag and the fact that increased hiv-induced cns inflammation increases risk of neurocognitive impairment74,75,76, we explored whether there were differential hiv-1 effects on executive function and/or verbal fluency for subjects infected with crf02_ag, compared to subjects infected with other hiv subtypes. analyses showed no difference in verbal fluency based on subtype groups but compared to subjects infected with ag-plus and non-ag hiv-1, subjects infected with crf02_ag viruses showed less deficit in ctt2, significantly less deficit in scwt and on the executive function summary t-score. this suggests that our previous findings of reduced inflammation with hiv-1 crf02_ag and tat.ag81,82 may also correlate with reduced impairment in executive functioning among subjects infected with crf02_ag viruses, compared to subjects infected with other hiv subtypes. our subsequent studies will determine whether there is a correlation between viral genotype, systemic inflammation, and risk of other neurocognitive impairments in these subjects.conclusion sin summary, our current study showed that after adjusting for age, gender and education, there was a significantly higher proportion of hiv+ cameroonians with impairments in executive functioning and verbal fluency compared to hiv- controls. also, we found that compared to subjects infected with crf02_ag viruses, infection with non-ag and ag-plus subtypes was associated with increased deficits in executive function. cross-sectionally, cart use, viral loads, and cd4 counts were not associated with np test scores, but a prospective, longitudinal study would be needed to clarify such effects. our current study provides normative data in healthy adults cameroonians (age 18–64) for four np tests often used to assess executive function (ctt2, hct, scwt, and wcst)25,26, and three np tests used to assess verbal fluency (action fluency, category fluency, and letter fluency)28,29. these data will be useful reference values for future research and clinical studies assessing impairments in executive function and verbal fluency in cameroon. these baseline metrics will also facilitate future investigation of diseases and other conditions affecting the brain frontal systems in cameroon.study limitationsthe subjects recruited here were mostly residents of yaoundé and its surrounding suburban neighborhoods, which may impact the generalizability of study results. however, yaoundé, the capital city, is the largest city in cameroon, with over 3 million inhabitants, and is a cosmopolitan city that includes people from diverse backgrounds and from all cameroonian ethnic groups14. although our sample size (742 subjects, 395 hiv− and 347 hiv+) was larger than sample sizes in many other studies of hand in ssa, we observed differences in age, education, and gender distribution between the two groups. although the use of demographically corrected test scores greatly mitigated these cohort differences, we cannot rule out the possibility that other (unmeasured) background differences may have affected the results (e.g. lower education could be associated with lower socio-economic status, but we did not have data on subjects’ socio-economic status).materials and methodspsychometric instrumentshalstead category testthe halstead category test (hct) used was a computer-based np test that involves reasoning, abstract thinking, problem-solving, attention, and memory35. for hct, the respondent examines a series of designs projected on a computer screen, to discern underlying principles or themes through trial and error learning and hypothesis testing35. for each test item, the respondent indicates their response by pressing the appropriate computer key on the answer panel. each response is followed by an immediate feedback consisting of a bell ring for a correct answer and a buzzer sound for a wrong answer. hct is a very sensitive measure of frontal lobe function that includes 7 subtests: subtests i and ii evaluate simple recognition of roman numerals and number counting; subtest iii assesses abstract reasoning; subtests iv, v and vi require spatial reasoning, while subtest vii evaluates learning and retention of the concepts associated with other subtests. at the end of the test administration, the software provides performance scores that include the total number of errors, and the number of errors made in each subtest35.wisconsin card sorting test-64wisconsin card sorting test-64 (wcst-64)37,39 is a measure of frontal lobe function that assesses the ability to learn simple concepts and think flexibly. wcst-64 is a computer-based sorting test for a deck of 64 cards, in which the respondent must adapt to changing sorting criteria. the wcst-64 scoring software provides performance scores, including total errors (the summary measure used here).color trails-iithe color trails-ii test (ctt2) measures attention, mental processing speed, and the ability to mentally control responses to irrelevant aspects of simultaneous stimulus patterns36. the color trails test has the sensitivity and specificity of the standard trail making test (part b) but may be less biased by differences in cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and its validity has been demonstrated in studies involving diverse populations25. the ctt2 consists of a sheet with pink and yellow circles numbered 1 to 25, where the respondent alternates between pink and yellow colors to rapidly connect sequentially numbered circles36. a stopwatch was used to record each trail completion time.stroop color-word interference test (scwt)the stroop color-word interference test (scwt) measures multiple cognitive functions dependent on the frontal lobe integrity, including attention capacity and ability to process and control interference38. the golden version of the scwt used in this study consisted of 3 pages/3 trails, each with 100 items presented in 5 columns of 20 items. the 1st page/trial consisted of color words “red”, “green”, “blue”, written in black ink (all in upper case letters), with subjects having to read aloud the words “red”, “green”, “blue” from left to right, as quickly as possible for 45 seconds (s). the 2nd page/2nd trial consists of a series of words written in congruent blue, red, or green ink colors (e.g., the word “blue” written in blue ink), and subjects had to name the color of each ink, from left to right, as quickly as possible for 45 seconds. the 3rd page/3rd trial consisted of an interference test, with the words “red”, “green”, “blue” (all in upper case letters) written in a different/incongruent ink from the color word (e.g. “red” written in blue or green ink), and subjects had to name the ink color as quickly as possible for 45 seconds. the scwt interference scores consisted of the number of items correctly identified during the 3rd trial (executive function trial).verbal fluency testsverbal fluency tests are often used to evaluate language and cognitive performance associated with frontal lobe function27,28,29,30. for the present study, tests of verbal fluency (letter fluency, category fluency, and action fluency) were administered as previously described24,83,84. briefly, for letter fluency, participants were instructed to generate as many words as possible that begin with the letter “f”, “a”, and “s”, within 60 seconds for each letter category. participants were instructed to avoid proper names (names of people or places), plurals, or a variation of the same word, and such words, as well as intrusions (words beginning with a different letter) were not counted. the total score consisted of the total number of “f”, “a”, and “s” words correctly generated within the time limits. for category fluency, participants were instructed to generate as many animals’ names as possible within 60 seconds. for action fluency, participants were instructed to name different things that people do, as many as possible, within 60 seconds. the scores consisted of the total number of correct verbs generated.training and adaptation of np teststhe np tests used in this study are part of the hiv neurobehavioral research center hnrc) international np test battery that we previously translated into french, and standardized and piloted in cameroon84. np tests were also back-translated into english, and back-translated tests were similar to the original english version of the tests84. this battery has been shown to be sensitive in detecting hand in several other settings, including in the usa85,86, india87, china48,83, brazil88,89, cameroon84, nigeria10,46,52,90, zambia91,92,93, and south africa51,94. the np tests were administered by trained psychometrists. to adapt np and neuromedical procedures to cameroon settings and ensure standardization, the cameroon investigators (jyf, rd, ak, gdk, akn) were trained and certified by american neuropsychologists and neuromedical personnel (df, rkh and his team) at the hnrc, university of california san diego, u.s. at the beginning of the study in cameroon, quality assurance reviews were conducted by hnrc scientists on test forms of the first 5 visits, and thereafter on randomly selected 5 to 10% of all visits.study populationa total of 395 healthy hiv seronegative (hiv−) controls and 347 hiv seropositive (hiv+) individuals were recruited between 2008 and 2017. the hiv+ cases were recruited from (1) the hiv voluntary counseling and testing sections of the day-care service in the yaoundé central hospital; (2) the yaoundé jamot hospital; (3) the efoulan district hospital, yaoundé; and (4) the etoug-ebe baptist hospital, yaoundé. seronegative controls were recruited from the same health services, as well as among (1) caregivers and visitors to the neurology outpatient clinic and day-care service in the yaoundé central hospital; (2) the health and social welfare centre of the university of yaoundé−1; and (3) yaoundé general population. the purpose of the study and research procedures were fully explained to participants and only adults at least 18 years old who did not have exclusion criteria and who gave a written consent were included in the study. the exclusion criteria were: (1) present or past history of cns disease unrelated to hiv, (2) head trauma, (3) current alcohol intoxication (blood alcohol content of each participant was measured using a breathalyzer), (4) known psychiatric disease or treatment with antipsychotic drugs, and (5) ongoing systemic illness or fever (temperature of 37.5 °c or higher). all subjects enrolled spoke french as their primary language and interviews and np testing were thus conducted in french.data collectionall participants provided demographic information, and underwent a complete medical history, a general physical examination, and a thorough neurological assessment by neurologists at the yaoundé central hospital to detect any focal neurological deficit suggestive of cns opportunistic infection, before psychometric testing. this thorough clinical assessment of each subject combined with review of his or her prior medical history and subsequent laboratory data, ensured that potential confounding factors such as existing cns opportunistic infections were ruled out. executive function (hct35, wcst37,39, ctt236, and scwt38) and verbal fluency (letter fluency, category fluency, and action fluency)24,83,84 tests were administered to each subject by trained psychometrists in the neuropsychology laboratory of the neurology department of the yaoundé central hospital, in a private, quiet and well-lit room. psychometric testing was done prior to blood and urine sample collections and laboratory analyses for hiv serology, cd4 counts, viral loads, and substance use.norming procedureemploying the norming methods described in detail by casaletto and colleagues40,41, raw scores of each np test were converted to uncorrected normalized scaled scores (ss, m = 10, sd = 3), and these ss were then calculated to t-scores corrected for age, gender, and education, using in-house r scripts. briefly, scaled scores were obtained by standardizing raw score quantiles and scaling them with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 3. scaled scores were then approximated as a function of age, gender, and education by fitting a multivariable fractional polynomial (mfp) model95, using r package mfp (https://cran.r-project.org). the mfp model searches for an appropriate transformation of numeric covariates and considers non-linear relationships of covariates with the outcome. stability of the mfp curves were checked through the sensitivity analyses for the mfp models using bootstrap procedure (k = 1000)96. the residuals obtained from the mfp model were standardized and converted into t-scores. the demographically corrected t-scores have a mean score of 50 and standard deviation of 10. t-scores for the hiv+ cohort were calculated from the formulas developed on the normative group. for each test, t-scores were converted to deficit scores to assess the degree of impairment (from 0 = no impairment [t = 40+] to 5 = severe impairment [t < 20]). domain t-scores and deficit scores represent the averaged values from the individual tests. “impairment” criteria were domain average deficit scores of >0.50, which ensure that, on average, the participant was at least mildly impaired on more than half of the test measures.hiv serology, cd4 cell counts, and viral loadssample collection and all analyses were performed in the hematology laboratory of the yaoundé university teaching hospital or the international reference centre chantal biya, cameroon. venous blood samples were collected and stored at room temperature in the outpatient clinic and analyses performed in the hematology laboratory within 6 hours of blood collection. the hiv status of each participant was determined using the rapid immunochromatographic hiv-1/2 test (abbott diagnostics, chicago, il, usa) and the murex hiv antigen/antibody combination elisa (abbott diagnostics), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a participant was considered hiv+ if he/she tested positive for the two tests, hiv− if negative for both tests, and discordant if positive for only one test. no discordant result was observed in this study.subjects’ cd4 t-lymphocyte counts were quantified by flow cytometry, using a fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs) count instrumentation system and the bd facscount cd4 reagent kit (bd biosciences, san jose, ca, usa), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the facs instrument was calibrated and quality control tested before each assay. for viral load determination, hiv rna copy number in each plasma sample was quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), using amplicor hiv-1 monitor test (roche diagnostic systems, pleasanton, ca), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the assay detection limit was 50 viral copies/ml.hiv amplification, sequencing and genotypingviral rna was extracted from plasma samples using the qiamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen inc., valencia, ca, usa), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. extracted rna (150 to 1200 ng) were reverse transcribed and amplified using a nested pcr with superscript one-step rt-pcr reverse transcriptase and platinum taq dna polymerase (life technologies, carlsbad, usa), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. hiv pr, rt, gag, env (c2v3), tat, and nef genes were amplified as we previously described17,18. primers sequences and reactions conditions are detailed in our previous publications17,18. amplicons were purified, sequenced at the university of nebraska medical center high-throughput dna sequencing and genotyping core facility, and nucleotide sequences analyzed as we previously described17,18.statistical analysesdemographic data were compared between controls and hiv+ subjects using student’s t-tests for continuous variables and fisher’s exact test for binary variables. univariable analysis was performed to examine the associations of t-scores for executive function tests (color trails-ii time, hct total errors, scwt and wcst total errors) and for verbal fluency tests (category fluency trial 1 words, action fluency, and letter fluency) with demographic factors (age, gender, and education) in controls and hiv+ subjects separately. the associations of raw scores for executive function and verbal fluency tests with demographic factors were also assessed. t-scores were compared between the two groups (hiv+ vs. hiv−). the proportions of neurocognitive impairment in executive function and verbal fluency tests (impaired if individual test deficit score ≥1) and domains (impaired if domain deficit score >0.5) were then compared between controls and hiv+ subjects using logistic regression. additionally, in hiv+ participants, t-scores were compared between treatment naïve and patients on cart, patients with higher (≥350) and low (<350) cd4 cell counts, and patients with undetectable (<50 copies/ml) and detectable (≥50 copies/ml) hiv rna viral loads, as well as hiv subtypes. for hiv+ patients on cart, three separate comparisons of cognitive scores were made between persons on regimens that do and do not contain nvp, between persons on regimens that do and do not contain zdv, and between persons with a history of one and multiple regimens. r software (version 3.4.1) was used to perform statistical analyses. results were considered statistically significant at a p-value of less than 0.05. cohen’s d effect sizes (and 95% confidence intervals) were reported for the differences between groups.ethical approval and informed consentthis study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the study protocol was approved by the cameroon national ethics committee, as well as the institutional review board of the university of nebraska medical center. all subjects gave written informed consent for inclusion before participating in the study.
