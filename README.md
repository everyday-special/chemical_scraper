## Scraping Chemicals from Recent Nature Publications

I was interested in creating a program that scrapes data from scientific literature and analyzes the article text. Working in an HIV focused laboratory, I decided I would look into that area of literature. As a lot of our research is focused on finding potential cures, I thought it would be interesting to look at the drugs being mentioned in the literature. Any drug mentioned in the literature might be being looked for its therapeutic potential. It might also be interesting to see what drugs show up that we are looking at in our lab.

## Chemical Reference List

First I needed a comprehensive list of chemicals/drugs to use as a reference. I decided to use the [ChEMBL database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) as it is a free and open database that I can download and load into a local mysql instance. ChEMBLdb has a wealth of information, but for my purposes I only needed two things: drug names (trade, common, etc.) and ChEMBL IDs (the chemicals ID in the ChEMBL database). These were extracted from the database in two csv files. [One csv file](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/synonyms.csv) contains drug names ('synonyms') and internal identifier numbers ('molreg no') and [the other csv file](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/chemblids.zip) contains ChEMBL IDs and the internal identifier numbers ('molreg no'). These files are named 'synonyms.csv' and 'chemblids.csv', respectively. I created a [script]() that links the synonyms with the ChEMBL IDs using the molreg numbers, putting the linked synonyms and ChEMBL IDs in a csv file called ['synonyms_chemblids.csv'](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/synonyms_chemblids.csv).

## Scraping Article Data from Recent Nature Publications

After setting up my chemical reference file, I needed to get some article data to investigate. I started off by searching 'HIV' in Nature, which gives me the 50 most HIV-relevent articles. I then made a [script](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/article_scraper.py) analyzing this search result. I used the Beautiful Soup Library to pull data from each of these 50 articles including the article title, article URL, article type, publication date, whether the article is open or not, and the article text (if the article is open). This data was stored in a csv file called ['article_scrapings.csv'](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/article_scrapings.csv).

## Finding the Chemicals Mentioned in the Articles

I then created a [final script](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/chemical_scraper.py) that cross references the chemicals and the article text. For each chemical that was mentioned in an article some data was saved. This included the amount of articles the chemical was mentioned in, the synonyms it was mentioned by, the titles of the articles it was mentioned in, and the url of the chemical in the online ChEMBL database. This information was then saved in a csv file called ['chemical_scraping_hiv.csv'](https://github.com/everyday-special/chemical_scraper/blob/master/chemical_scrapings_hiv.csv). You can find sample entries of 'chemical_scrapings_hiv.csv' below. It is important to note that if the 'article_scraper.py' script is re-run, these entries may change based on changing search results over time.
